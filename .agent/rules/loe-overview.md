### About the project

This codebase is for migrating the existing website at http://loe.org to a new one based on Markdown content with the site generated by Pelican. You will be asked to scrape varous pages from this website, parse them, and turn the content into Markdown and potentially modify or write HTML/CSS/Python to render the Markdown properly.

### Constraints

* Do **not** generate images, unless explicitly asked to.
* Do **not** modify things in the content/ folder, unless either explicitly asked to or via running a migration script like `scrape_archives.py`.
* Write any scripts that you execute for various tasks to the scripts/ directory.
* The Python code runs in venv in the venv/ folder, you need to use that to run any Python code or to run Pelican.
* Use the YAML metadata format for metadata inside of Markdown files, e.g.:
