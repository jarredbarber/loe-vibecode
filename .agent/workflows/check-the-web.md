description: Check the latest show for issues.
---

This workflow builds a report of the latest show.

- Locate the latest show in the content/shows folder.
- Check that segments are referenced in the show.md file.
- Make sure that metadata is populated and reasonable.
- Check images for captions. Check captions for grammar.
- Validate that all URLs are valid, e.g. image URLs return 200 status codes.
- Validate audio embed points somewhere with a reasonably matching title
- Look for markdown formatting errors
- Make sure the transcript for each segment is not obviously truncated.

Lastly, compile your findings into a report.

This is a multi-step verification task that will require:

- Finding the latest show
- Reviewing its content and segments
- Checking various aspects of the content
- Creating a report
