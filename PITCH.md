# Why We Built a Modern Site for Living on Earth

We are upgrading Living on Earth from `"The Old Way"` to `"The Modern Way"`. Here is why this matters to you.

## 1. Reliability (Oral Tradition vs. The Printed Book)

* **The Old Site (Oral Tradition)**: Like a storyteller recounting a tale from memory, the old server has to "remember" and assemble every page from scratch each time someone visits. If the storyteller gets tired or forgets a detail (database crash), the story stops. It is fragile and labor-intensive.
* **The New Site (The Printed Book)**: We "print" the website once when we save our work. When a user visits, the page is already waiting for them, perfect every time. It cannot "crash" because there is no active effort required to show it. It just exists, solid and reliable.

## 2. Speed

* **Then**: 🐢 The server had to "think" before showing every page.
* **Now**: 🐇 **Instant.** Because the pages are pre-built, they load immediately. This is crucial for listeners on mobile phones or slow connections.

## 3. Security

* **Then**: 🔓 **Vulnerable.** The old site had login screens and databases that hackers could try to break into.
* **Now**: 🔒 **Unhackable.** The new site has no database and no public login screen. It is just read-only text files. There is nothing to hack.

## 4. Ownership

* **Then**: ☁️ **trapped.** Your content was locked inside a complex database format. Moving to a new web host was a massive, expensive project.
* **Now**: 📂 **Freedom.** Every story is a simple text file (`.md`) that you can see, read, and back up on your own computer. You own your data forever. You can move to any web host in the world in 10 minutes.

## 5. Cost

* **Then**: 💰 **Expensive.** You paid for servers to run the database and the complex code 24/7.
* **Now**: 🆓 **Free.** Because the site is just simple files, it costs almost nothing to host.
