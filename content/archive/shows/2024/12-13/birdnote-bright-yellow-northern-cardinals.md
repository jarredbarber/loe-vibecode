## Transcript

DOERING: Most of the 21 new cardinals Pope Francis elevated to the elite body on December 7 now have the honor of wearing the traditional scarlet vestments. But two in the Dominican order chose to continue to wear simple white robes. And when it comes to cardinals that fly, you might be surprised to learn that they don’t all dress in red, either. Ariana Remmel has this BirdNote.

Bright Yellow Northern Cardinals

Written by Conor Gearin

REMMEL: Northern Cardinals are known for their iconic red feathers. Males are bright scarlet, and females sport red wing and crest feathers. So if you saw a Northern Cardinal that was lemon-yellow, you might think it was a different species entirely.

In fact, these are Northern Cardinals, but with a genetic mutation. All cardinals ingest yellow pigments in their food. Most cardinals’ bodies change them into red pigments, giving their feathers their signature shade. But just a few cardinals lack this ability — resulting in a bright yellow bird.

Unexpectedly yellow birds occur in other species, too, from House Finches that look like they’ve been dipped in egg yolk, to Red-bellied Woodpeckers with golden-hued head feathers. The condition is called xanthochromism.

Xanthochromism and other color abnormalities are rare — just a handful in every few million bird sightings. And the causes for these conditions vary. For House Finches, diet alone is probably enough to turn them yellow.

Field guides show only a few illustrations for a single species. But part of the fun is finding all the shades of variation in well-known birds.
