Melanin Makes Feathers Stronger

Written by Conor Gearin

[Ring-billed Gull calls]

If you take a look at birds’ wings, you might notice a pattern. Many species have black feathers on the trailing edge of their wings, regardless of what color most of their feathers are. Birds as different as gulls, pelicans, storks, and flamingos all have black-tipped wings.

These flight feathers are rich in a pigment called melanin. But melanin doesn’t just provide color. It also helps make feathers stronger. Feathers with melanin have a tougher layer of keratin — the same substance found in human fingernails — compared to feathers without. So the black feathers actually help protect a wing from wear and tear.

That’s especially useful on the edge of a birds’ wing, where air is rushing past during flight. Melanin helps the wing stay aerodynamic and efficient for birds so they can gather food, escape from predators, and complete their long migratory journeys.

While it takes energy to produce melanin, it saves birds the trouble of replacing feather after feather when traveling thousands of miles.
