**Intern Applications Open!** We are now accepting applications for our Fall 2025 internship program, which you can find out more about by [clicking here.](https://www.loe.org/about/jobs.html) We have never once asked an intern to fetch us a cup of coffee! Instead, interns have the opportunity to learn our journalistic process, acquire audio editing skills, and navigate the current media landscape. Here are a few key points about the program: 

* Our internships are unpaid, but we are happy to assist with work-study applications and fill out any forms needed for class credit.
* The program runs from Labor Day through December.
* It’s about three days a week.
* The program is entirely remote and is open to anyone in an American timezone.

Applications are due on Aug 22, 2025. Please email the following to our Managing Producer, Jenni Doering at [jdoering@loe.org](mailto:jdoering@loe.org):

* Resume
* Cover letter
* Two writing or audio samples

We look forward to hearing from you!

[**Slippery Beast: A True Crime Natural History, with Eels**](https://www.loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00031#feature1) 
  
Eels play an important ecological role in many rivers and streams, but they’re so eel-usive that even eel scientists have been challenged to observe them mating in the wild. Ellen Ruppel Shell is author of the book *Slippery Beast: A True Crime Natural History, with Eels*, and she speaks with Host Paloma Beltran about the eel’s murky ecology and path through the seafood industry.  
  
[**Uprooted By Climate**](https://www.loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00031#feature2) 
  
The relentless heating of the Earth is prompting people to move after climate-related catastrophes and amid more gradual changes. Journalist Abrahm Lustgarten is the author of *On the Move: The Overheating Earth and the Uprooting of America*, and he talks with Host Steve Curwood about the northward migration he anticipates as Americans seek to escape punishing heat, fire, and drought. 
  
[**Starborn: How the Stars Made Us**](https://www.loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00031#feature3) 
  
Stargazing has profoundly shaped who we are as human beings, and gave rise to science, religion, and origin stories from diverse traditions. Cosmologist Roberto Trotta explores this legacy in his book *Starborn: How the Stars Made Us (And Who We Would Be Without Them)*. He joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss how studying the night sky shaped science and why satellites now threaten our connection to the stars.
