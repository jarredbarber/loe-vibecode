In Case You Missed It Hi Everyone! 
  
Last week’s reruns covered everything from air pollution, to orangutans, and even our relationship to outer space. It also included a new segment about the fate of fireflies. In case you missed it, you are welcome to check out the links below.

Thousands of people across the United States live near industrial facilities and petrochemical plants that expose them to higher levels of air pollution, but chemical exposure risk is commonly regulated one chemical at a time. A study conducted by a group of Johns Hopkins researchers found that “fence line” residents are at higher risk for multiple health problems because of the toxic mix of air they breathe.

Astronomer Philip Plait wondered what it would be like to walk on Mars, fall into a black hole, or fly through a nebula, so he wrote a book, *Under Alien Skies: A Sightseer’s Guide to the Universe*. He reveals the strange colors of a sunset on Mars, what it’s like on a planet orbiting binary stars, the unique challenges of landing on an asteroid, and more.

The summertime magic of fireflies lighting up at dusk is facing threats because of climate change and habitat destruction. Living on Earth’s Ashanti Mclean shares a few tips that can help to protect firefly species. 
  
[**Animal Self-Medication**](https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00032&segmentID=4) 
  
A paper published in the journal Scientific Reports describes the case study of an orangutan who treated and healed his own wound. Zoologists have long seen behaviors of self-medicating in the animal kingdom, but until now it has rarely if ever been documented in scientific literature. Michael Huffman, an ecologist who reviewed the paper, discusses how some animals heal themselves.
