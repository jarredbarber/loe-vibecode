**Living on Earth’s Fall Campaign is Underway**

You and other listeners like you are Living on Earth’s most reliable funding resource. 

If you’re reading this you already know that each week Living on Earth connects you with our array of stories every week covering environmental issues, ideas, challenges, politics and solutions. 

You most likely also know that public radio is in an intensely challenging moment with federal funding for public radio having recently been rescinded.

LoE has always benefited from the generosity of our listeners and readers. Each year, a significant portion of our support comes from listeners like you.

If you’re already a Living on Earth supporter, thank you!

If you’ve been considering supporting LoE, now is a great time to [**give during our fall fundraiser**](https://loe.org/about/donate.html).

Thank you for supporting Living on Earth.
