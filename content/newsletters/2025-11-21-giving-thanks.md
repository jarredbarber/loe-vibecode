Giving Thanks It might be a little early for a year-end message, but this week felt like a good moment to share some reflections on the year just past. Through a tumultuous year for public radio, Living on Earth has continued to grow and thrive, [thanks as always in great part to you, our listeners and readers](https://loe.org/about/donate.html). Here are just a few of our accomplishments we wanted to share. 
  
**LoE Interns** 
Living on Earth’s internship program is closing in on 400 participants across our 34 years of broadcast. LoE interns have gone on to careers as journalists and professors, among many other professions. One LoE intern alum went on to serve as the mayor of Princeton, New Jersey. LoE interns bring incredible energy, enthusiasm, and new ideas to the Living on Earth editorial process.  
  
By the way, if you or someone you know might be interested in a Living on Earth internship, this is “last call” to apply for Spring 2026 by Wednesday, November 26th! Learn more [here](https://loe.org/about/jobs.html).  
  
**Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media** 
The [Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media](https://cejm.media/), based at the University of Massachusetts Boston [School for the Environment](https://www.umb.edu/environment/), tells compelling stories of environmental and climate justice through radio broadcasts, podcasts, and multi-media communications, while also providing media instruction for UMass Boston students and faculty. The Center draws voices from a broad diversity of experiences, striving to fairly and accurately inform local, regional, and global communities about today’s and tomorrow’s critical environmental and climate justice concerns. 
  
CEJM hosted its first ever conference at UMass Boston on September 17-18, with more than 200 attendees. The conference featured Dr. Robert Bullard, father of environmental justice and Distinguished Professor at Texas Southern University, Dr. David Cash, the newly appointed Director of Harvard’s Climate Action Accelerator, and Goldman Environmental Prize winner Nalleli Cobo. The event brought together environmental justice leaders and community activists from all around the country.  
  
**LoE Stories** 
A key part of every week at Living on Earth is our conversation about the past week’s program. The entire LoE team listens to every episode and shares thoughts about what we loved and potential refinements to future episodes. Heading into the holiday season seems like a great time to share a few of the stories that were favorites for the LoE team this past year. 
  
[**Oyster Trash to Treasure**](https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00035&segmentID=1) 
Oysters on the half shell are big business on Nantucket Island, and a local program recycles oyster shells from restaurant waste into habitat for young oysters. Host Aynsley O’Neill reports on how these recycled oyster shell reefs are helping to protect the coastline from worsening storms and rising seas. 
  
[**Pope Leo and Creation Care**](https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00020&segmentID=1) 
The new Pope, Leo XIV, has worked with interfaith environmental networks and there’s hope around the world that he may follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Pope Francis and bring issues of the environment and climate change to the forefront of his agenda. Dr. Erin Lothes is a former professor of Catholic theology who now promotes global eco spirituality education and climate action with the Laudato Si’ Movement and she joins Host Aynsley O’Neill to shed light on Pope Leo XIV’s rhetoric on environment. 
  
[**Deb Haaland on Our Public Lands**](https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00013&segmentID=4) 
Deb Haaland became the first Native American cabinet member when President Biden appointed her as Secretary of the Interior and helped consult with tribes to designate new national monuments. Now she’s running for Governor of New Mexico, and Deb Haaland joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss the current threats to public lands and her deep ancestral connections to the New Mexican landscape 
  
**You** 
None of our work can happen without you. The support we receive from listeners fuels our work. Whether it’s sharing the Living on Earth podcast or newsletter with a friend, sharing a comment about a favorite story, or [making a gift to LoE](https://loe.org/about/donate.html), we deeply appreciate the role you play in helping LoE thrive! 
  
As you consider which organizations to include as part of your holiday season 2025 giving, we hope Living on Earth will be on your short list. 
  
Thank you!  **Mark Kausch**
