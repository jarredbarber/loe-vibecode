Hello,

Though it’s been a tumultuous year for public radio, Living on Earth has continued to grow and thrive, thanks as always in great part to you, our listeners and readers. 

None of our work can happen without you. The support we receive from listeners fuels our work. Whether it’s sharing the Living on Earth podcast or newsletter with a friend, sharing a comment about a favorite story, or [**making a gift to LoE**](https://loe.org/about/donate.html), we deeply appreciate the role you play in helping LoE thrive!

As you consider which organizations to include as part of your Giving Tuesday donations, we hope Living on Earth will be on your short list.

You can make your gift to [**Living on Earth here**](https://loe.org/about/donate.html).

Thank you!

p.s. If you’ve already made a donation, thank you! Your support is greatly appreciated!
