## Internships

We are offering virtual/remote internships in Spring 2026! We can work with anyone on U.S. Eastern time zone through Pacific time, and are open to considering other time zones as well. Interns who are based in the Northeast may have the opportunity to occasionally work with us in person in our Boston office and/or the field. We are now accepting applications for Spring 2026. Please submit your application by Wednesday, November 26.

A Living on Earth internship provides an invaluable introduction to broadcast media. Each semester, we rely on a handful of bright, capable interns to contribute to our award-winning program, and experience first-hand what goes on behind the scenes of a nationally-distributed public radio news magazine and associated podcasts.

### The Editorial Interns

The editorial interns assist in various phases of story production for the Living on Earth broadcast and its sister podcasts, from finding and researching original stories and helping track down experienced correspondents, contacts and newsmakers, to editing host interviews. They monitor news wires and newspapers for environmental affairs. Interns generate questions for interviews, pre-interview guests, and retrieve archive tape and other source material. They develop an ear for good tape, and each intern is encouraged to write and narrate two short segments for the Living on Earth program and/or its podcast family.

Candidates require strong writing and communication skills and should submit a resume, cover letter, and two writing and/or audio samples. Some experience in journalism, environmental sciences, and public policy is helpful, but not required. Successful interns demonstrate an innate curiosity about life on Earth and the environment and science topics our show covers. Some familiarity with and interest in current podcasts is strongly encouraged.

Interns agree to serve one term and are usually limited to one term. They commit to working three full days per week or equivalent. Please note: this is an unpaid internship, and we will work with you to apply for work-study or other compensation if available.

Internships generally follow this approximate schedule:

* Spring Term: January through Memorial Day
* Summer Term: May/June through mid-August
* Fall Term: Labor Day through December

**To apply:** Please email a resume, cover letter, and two strong audio and/or writing samples to jdoering@loe.org by November 26th.
