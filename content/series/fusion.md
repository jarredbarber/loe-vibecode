description: The prospect of producing power from fusion has tantalized scientists for many years, with good reason. Just look up at the sky. The constant burning of the sun and stars – a process that has lasted billions of years – is powered by fusion reactions. Since the 1950s, scientists have tried unsuccessfully to replicate this phenomenon on earth. Yet despite the slow pace of research, recent advances have led researchers to believe that in the future it will in fact be possible to build and operate a fusion power plant. Though still decades away, fusion could provide a limitless, nearly pollution-free form of energy.
