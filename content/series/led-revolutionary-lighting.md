description: The Future of LightA flick of a switch at home can set a handful of lightbulbs aglow. Open the car door, or the refrigerator door, and a light comes on. City streets are illuminated by overhead lights, stores brightly advertise their presence through light. Lighting accounts for twenty percent of all energy use in the US. All this light, however, comes at a cost; producing the electricity creates pollution from power plants and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing energy needs from lighting even just by half could save billions of dollars and help wean us off our dependence on oil.
