description: Only eight bear species are known to science: The American black bear; the grizzly; the polar bear; the South American spectacled bear; Asia’s sun bear, moon bear, and sloth bear; and the Chinese panda. The moon bears’ lineage (most similar to that of the American black bear) as black-coated mountain dwellers had never been challenged—until author Sy Montgomery and her scientific colleagues turned up a new golden form.
