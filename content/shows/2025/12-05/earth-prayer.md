## Transcript

CURWOOD: On the line now from Porter Corners, New York, is Joe Bruchac, a Nulhegan Abenaki storyteller and poet who’s here with his reflection on gratitude for the gifts of the Earth. Joe, good to talk to you again. How you doing?

BRUCHAC: Oh, I'm good, kwai kwai nidôbak, hello my friend.

CURWOOD: And what do you have for us today?

BRUCHAC: I have an original poem that I wrote. It's based on traditions among the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois people, and the Wabanaki, my own people, of giving thanks and acknowledgement for the gifts that we often take for granted that are all around us. It's called “Earth Prayer.”

EARTH PRAYER (Adapted from Haudenosaunee and Wabanaki traditions)

Because this Earth is our first mother

we say Ktsi Wliwini, mina ta mina--

Great Thanks, again and again.

Because all our ancestors could see

the rain that falls, the air we breathe

the healing waters, the giving stones

our mother’s blood, our mother’s bones

are gifts we have been given.

It is from this Earth that all our lives,

those who came before us, those yet to come

like the seeds that sprout with each new spring

have grown, have grown, have grown.

And what does this Earth ask of us?

All that it asks is that we never

take too much, always remember

to give back in equal measure

for those gifts we may take for granted.

And also remember that we must

walk with care, always show kindness

to all those now here with us

sharing gifts of life and light,

never forget those who share our breath

two-legged, four-legged, those with wings.

those who swim or dig into the soil,

the grass, the trees, all living things

from the greatest to those too small

to see are also related, one and all,

Wli dogo wongan, all our relations.

So, as we continue on this circle

which has no beginning and no end

let us all say to our Mother Earth

Ktsi Wliwini, mina ta mina--

Great Thanks, again and again.

CURWOOD: Thank you, Joe Bruchac.

BRUCHAC: Doc hug we, don't mention it. You are very welcome.
