Wassail, wassail, all over the town,

Our toast it is white and our ale it is brown;

Our bowl it is made of the white maple tree,

With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee,

Drink to thee, drink to thee,

With the wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee.

Oh here is to Cherry and to his right eye,

May God send my master a good Christmas pie,

And a good Christmas pie that may we all see;

With our wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee.

Drink to thee, drink to thee,

With our wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee.

Oh here's to the cow and to her right horn,

May God send my mistress a good crop of corn,

And a good crop of corn that may we all see;

With a wassailing bowl we’ll drink to thee

Drink to thee, drink to thee,

With a wassailing bowl we'll drink to thee.
