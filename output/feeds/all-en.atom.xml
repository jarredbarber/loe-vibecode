&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in September of 1989, along with a poem from John Updike and fiction from Muriel Spark, the New Yorker Magazine published what they called a Reflection with the title of "The End of Nature - The rise of greenhouse gases and our warming earth. ” It was penned by a writer in his late 20’s named Bill McKibben and he has been telling that story and calling us to action pretty much ever since. On the line now from Vermont is Bill McKibben and his latest book is called &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a more optimistic take on this world than your first book, &lt;em&gt;The End of Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Bill, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, you know optimism may not be exactly the right word. I mean, look, the things that we were warning about in &lt;em&gt;The End of Nature&lt;/em&gt; now almost 40 years ago, have happened. The planet is now warming fast. The scientists were absolutely right. We face an endless series of disasters that will get worse. This is the main legacy of our moment on Earth so far, but as of the last three years, four years, we finally have a tool, not at this point, to stop global warming with — it's too late for that — but perhaps to at least shave some tenths of a degree off how hot the planet gets. And that tool is cheap energy from the sun and the wind and the batteries to store that power when the sun goes down or the wind drops. This stuff that we called for all of our lives. Steve, alternative energy no longer is. It's now the common sense, obvious, straightforward way to make power on this planet, which is why 95% of new generating capacity around planet Earth last year came from these clean sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Bill, looking back to &lt;em&gt;The End of Nature&lt;/em&gt; some almost 40 years ago, the key point in your book &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, is that, you know, we have all that we need to arrest this progression of of climate disruption, maybe not stop it completely, but at least have it be functional enough for our civilization. What inspired you to write this book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free Electricity. Like, at no cost. For everyone. Now. by Bill McKibben&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about affordability, abundance, and Australia--and why thanks to Trump we can't have nice things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/free-electricity-like-at-no-cost"&gt;Read on Substack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, mostly because I felt like I had a scoop. You know, I and I'm an old journalist at heart, like you. I do this newsletter every week on Substack called The Crucial Years, which, I think, because it's free, has turned into the largest newsletter of its kind around climate and energy and the environment. And it means that I get to keep track of all the things that are happening, you know, on a kind of weekly basis around the world. And about 36 months ago, if you were paying attention, you couldn't help but notice this sudden spike beginning. We'd finally hit the steep part of the S curve, you know. And all of a sudden there were stories coming in from around the world, especially, it must be said, China, which is providing the leadership here, and which is doing things on a almost inconceivable scale. In May, the Chinese were building three gigawatts of solar panels a day. As you know, a gigawatts, the rough equivalent of a big coal fired power plant. They were putting up one of those out of solar panels every eight hours. I mean, this is, you know, this is like building the pyramids or something, the scale at which this is going on. And it's... there're similar stories to be told from many corners of the world, and they just keep coming. I don't know whether you saw the news a couple of weeks ago, but I've been writing and talking about it ever since. In the country of Australia, where they've built so much solar power that the government has now decided that electricity will be free for all Australians for three hours every afternoon. I mean, human beings for 700,000 years have worked hard to get energy for our lives if it meant collecting firewood, if it meant paying your electric bill. Now you don't have to do that anymore, at least if you're in a place that's had the foresight to build the solar panels and the wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beginning on July 1, 2026, Australia will provide everyone with free electricity for three hours each afternoon. (Photo: D. O'Donnell/ESA, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_australia.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Bill, how will a transition to solar power address global inequality and the disparities that exist in the developing world, and actually in parts of our country as well, many of which came to be because of the fossil fuel industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: I mean, as long as you rely on a source of power that's only available in a few places, the people who control those places will end up with inordinate wealth and power. John D. Rockefeller, the first plutocrat, was the first guy to recognize that. His heirs include Vladimir Putin, you know, who's using his winnings to run a land war in Europe in the 21st Century. They include the Koch brothers, our biggest oil and gas refiners and pipeline suppliers, who use their winnings to systematically undermine our democracy. They include the King of Saudi Arabia who likes to cut up journalists like you and me with saws. The world on the other side of this is very different, because there's sun and wind everywhere, for everyone, and it works best the sun anyway, towards the equator. So this is perhaps even a way to start rebalancing a little bit of this North, South division. If you're in the 80% of humanity that lives in countries that have to import fossil fuel, this couldn't be really better news, because once you've paid the money to build your solar panel or your wind turbine, then you no longer have to come up with American money, cash on the barrel head to buy the next tanker load full of oil. Pakistanis, mostly working by themselves, without government help, have put up so many solar panels in the last few years that the Pakistani government last month, canceled the delivery of 27 I think, huge cargo loads full of liquefied natural gas from Qatar. They had to pay a penalty, but it was cheaper to pay the penalty than to import this gas that they didn't need anymore because now they've got lots of solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exxon Mobil, the largest direct successor of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, is one of the largest contributors to global warming and pollution from greenhouse gas emissions and toxic spills.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Bill, we have enough money on the planet to make the transition that's required to really put the brakes on this advance towards climate disruption. So what's keeping folks from providing the resources for poor fossil fuel trapped countries, from making the full transition right away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, to some degree, it's really starting to happen. And it's happening with Chinese financing and Chinese technology. The Chinese exported half again as much worth of green tech last year as America did of oil and gas. But the force that's slowing down all of this, of course, is the fossil fuel industry, which understands this good news for everybody else as the worst possible news for its future prospects, and they have trillions of dollars worth of hydrocarbons in the ground at today's market prices that they would like to get out and sell for trillions of dollars, which they won't be able to do if we're busily converting to sun, wind, to EVs, and heat pumps. And so they're doing, as you as you know, everything they possibly can to stop that transition. In our country, where their work is the most advanced, that meant when Donald Trump asked them for a billion dollars in campaign donations last year, they came up with about half a billion in donations and advertising and lobbying in the last election cycle, and that was enough to convince the President to, you know, shut down wind farms off the coast of New England that were 80% complete, or put the kibosh on huge solar farm couple weeks ago in Nevada that by itself, one solar farm, would have powered 2 million homes, more than 1% of American homes. You know, we can't have this stuff that the rest of the world is busily building because our oil and gas industry has corrupted our President, not that that was a very hard task, and so now we get to pretend that climate change isn't real, that green energy doesn't work, and that we're somehow all going to go back and inhabit the 1950s again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="China is currently leading global solar power expansion, at one point adding roughly three gigawatts of new capacity in a single day, according to McKibben. Above, solar panels installed on an aquaculture farm near Qingdao, China.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Nixon, President Nixon famously saying, "What do you want us to live like animals?" But, but Bill, what's going on here in the United States and much of the rest of the world to let's just call it native intelligence. Why is it that people are acting this stupid. Let's be blunt about it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: All transitions are hard and they involve, you know, change, and our species doesn't deal particularly well with change. And in this case, as you know, better than almost anyone, we've had 35 years of full on disinformation campaign from the fossil fuel industry about climate change, about alternative energy, all designed to drive home the idea that only the way that we're doing things now could possibly work. And that's sunk in with too many people, especially in this country, but the rest of the world is quickly shaking off that habit, I think. And, you know, you could tell just watching in Belém in Brazil at the climate talks this year that, you know, people are sort of moving past the US, like we're sort of receding into the rearview mirror, you know. And it's becoming clearer and clearer where the future lies. Now, as patriotic Americans, that should upset us. These technologies were all invented in the US. The first solar cell is 1954 at Bell Labs in New Jersey. The first industrial wind turbine is 1941 at Grandpa's Knob in Vermont, about 30 miles south of where I'm talking to you from. We could have owned these technologies, and instead, we've just ceded them to our theoretical main rival on this planet. I don't think really there's been an act of national self sabotage quite like this that I can think of anywhere in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="McKibben predicts that countries like China will gain a large economic advantage in the global market due to their headstart in producing cheap, renewable energy. Above, solar panels on a China Steel Corporation facility in Taiwan.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So let's talk more about geopolitics. As you say, China has figured this out. What does this mean for this nation and the world going forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, if we don't get our act together, then, you know, someday, someday the US will be the Colonial Williamsburg of internal combustion, and people will come here to gawk at how people lived back in the old days when they had to set stuff on fire in order to make their lives work. I anticipate that sometime before that, we will break out of the current spell that we're living under, and people will begin to realize that it's not going to work very well to try and run an economy on expensive energy when the rest of the world is running their economies on cheap energy. And I don't think any amount of Trumpian bluster will make up for that. Look, they're trying. They obviously designed tariff policy as a kind of shake down on precisely this issue, country after country, if they agree to buy billions of dollars worth of American liquefied natural gas see their tariffs cut in half. But even if that works in the very short run, any government being extorted like that is going to think to itself, "I do not want this to continue. I'd just as soon buy some of this solar panels from China, and after that, I won't depend on China, I won't depend on the erratic and unreliable U.S. I'll just depend on the sun, which heretofore, has made its appearance pretty much every morning."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: We are spending this hour with environmentalist and author Bill McKibben, talking about the climate emergency and his book, &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t go away. We’ll be right back after a short break. You’re listening to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANNOUNCER: Support for Living on Earth comes from the Waverley Street Foundation, working to cultivate a healing planet with community-led programs for better food, healthy farmlands, and smarter building, energy and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUSIC: Stanley Turrentine, “Sunny” on The Spoiler (Reissue), The Blue Note Label Group]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Steve Curwood, and let’s continue our discussion now with climate activist Bill McKibben, whose 2025 book is &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Now, we’re talking about climate disruption, but you know research shows that just here in the United States, we have 300,000 excess deaths from the particulates from burning fossil fuel. Why isn't this a big public health issue? 300,000 people a year dying, Bill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="President Donald Trump called climate change the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” during his speech at the United Nations on September 23, 2025.

&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Yeah, well, because they don't... they don't all die in one place right in front of you, where you can see it happening. You know, in order for that statistic to make sense, you have to actually, like pay attention and trust the medical establishment, which we've now decided to vilify. You know, I mean, a country that doesn't want to be vaccinated against serious disease may not be paying as much attention as they should to the weekly mortality and morbidity reports out of the National Institute of Health, which doubtless are being shut down anyway. I don't have an answer for you about why we're behaving as irrationally as we are. My sense is that it can't last forever because reality will catch up. You know, there's the physical reality of climate change and of the public health reality that you describe that comes with a heavy economic penalty. And then there's the economic reality of the fact that we're, for some reason, deciding to double down on expensive energy when the rest of the world is going to cheap energy. I mean, look, there are any number of ways that the United States is behaving irrationally right at the moment. I'm doing my best to slow it down. We've got a we've got Third Act. This group we formed for older folk like me three years ago. We've now got 110,000 of us across the country. We're busy working on climate and on democracy. You may have noticed at your local no Kings Day protest that our age group was over represented, and we intend to keep it that way, because, well, in part, because we grew up in an era when we could see government action working. You know, the first Earth Day got us the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and then our air and our water got a lot cleaner. So we understand that this was possible once, and we don't understand why it's not possible now. So we're going to do our best to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So your book, &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, is, I guess, a handbook for people who are trying to wrap their heads around this notion that, "Hey, it really does make a lot of sense to make the transition away from fossil fuel and will be better for us." It's not just, I think you use the term, it's not like the Whole Foods of energy, that so called alternative energy. No, this is the, this is the main game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Solar panels near the Xiyuan River in China. An increased demand for electricity in China, in part due to the rise of AI, has made building clean energy infrastructure more important now than ever.

&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: This is the Costco of energy man — cheap, available in bulk, on the shelf, ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So how is this book doing? To what extent are people grabbing this and saying, "Oh, I... Oh, my goodness, this really is possible to make a change?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: It's doing well. It's been fun. And, you know, I brought it out so, mostly so that we could use it as a kind of organizing vehicle for this thing in September that we called Sun Day, not Earth Day, but Sun Day. And the first iteration of that went great. We had 500 events across the country that you can read a beautiful account of it in the Times. So people are waking up, and I think that they'll wake up more as the next year goes on. My guess is that one of the two or three key issues for the midterm elections on which all attention will be focused are going to be the electricity prices, which are soaring, as you would expect, because we're permitting every data center that anyone could ever want to build at exactly the same moment that we're constricting the supply of sun and wind. You don't need to be a Nobel Prize-winning economist to know that when you increase demand and decrease supply, price is going to rise, and that's exactly what's happening. So, hopefully, there'll be increased attention as we go forward, and as the planet gets hotter and hotter, it will continue to summon people's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now you have a whole chapter on affordability in this book, &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, which understandably is a big question for people right now, when it comes to transitioning to solar and and other forms of renewable energy. Let's take a micro look here. Walk us through the numbers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Balcony solar are small, plug-in solar panel systems designed for apartments, balconies, and patios. The technology has taken off in Germany and much of the EU but has yet to become legal in most places in the United States. (Photo: Nikolai Twin, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_balconysolar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, I mean, if you want to get really micro, let's look at people's homes. It costs three times as much to put solar on your roof in the US as it does in Australia or the EU. Most of the world, you just... if you want solar on your roof, you call up some guy on Monday morning, and by Friday afternoon, the panels are up there pumping out power. In this country, wall. We are burdened with endless excess bureaucracy. We've got 15,000 municipalities in this country, each one has their own building code. They'd like to send a team of inspectors up on the roof. It takes months to get all this done, and that drives the price through the well, through the roof, I guess you would say. We can get around this. The National Renewable Energy Lab, a couple of years ago, put out this thing called the SolarAPP+ that essentially allows for instant permitting. A contractor just types in the address and the piece of equipment that he's going to put on top, and as long as the computer likes it, then they give him an instant permit, and he or she is up there on the roof, hammer in hand. That's how it works, as I say, everywhere else. An even more remarkable example is what the Europeans are calling balcony solar, what you could call plug in solar. Across Germany and Italy and Belgium and places, millions of Europeans in the last three years have gone to their, I don't know, whatever you call Best Buy in Italy, and come home with a solar panel designed not to go on the roof, but just to be hung from the railing of your balcony on your apartment. And, in the back, it has a standard plug that you just stick into a wall, no electrician needed. This often produces 20%, 25% of the power that an apartment uses. It's a great gateway drug to renewable energy, and it's illegal everywhere in this country, except that progressive Bastion, the state of Utah, which in March by unanimous vote of the state legislature passed the enabling legislation. The Republican senator who proposed it, when I talked to him, said, "Well, you know, if it's good enough for the people of Stuttgart, why should it be denied the people of Salt Lake City?" And in the wake of Sun Day, I think we have legislation now in about 15 state legislatures to get the same thing done here. One of the things about renewable energy, solar power, is that it's not as bound by partisan and ideological divisions as some other things. I've lived in rural America all my life, red state and blue, and so I have lots of neighbors who have Trump flags in the mailbox and solar panels on the roof. And if you ask them, why a church or fire company or whatever, the answer boils down to, "My home is my castle, and it's a better castle if it has an independent power supply." That's not why I put solar panels on my roof, a quarter century ago. I did it because I care deeply about climate change, but I'm also enough of an American to feel that other impulse too. I like the fact that I don't have to depend as much on utilities and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pictured above is the Broken Hill Solar Plant, New South Wales. Solar power is a major contributor to electricity supply in Australia. (Photo: Jeremy Buckingham, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_brokenhill.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Wait a second. Bill McKibben, what you're saying is there's no ideology then to solar and and other renewable forms of energy, and yet we seem to be tied up in this ideological knot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: It's not ideological in this country. It's the power of money. The fossil fuel industry does not want us to stop using coal and gas and oil, so they are done everything they can to make sure that we don't. And that's where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: But Bill, it is ideological. Because when you look at the Supreme Court case Citizens United, which allowed corporations to put as much money as they wanted into politics, that's based on ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Fair enough, but that's based on the ideology of... I mean, if you took a vote on Citizens United in this country, the vast majority of Americans do not want corporations running our political life. They just took a vote among Supreme Court justices who have been, you know, specially tailored by the Federalist Society for decades now to fall in line behind corporate projects. So I don't think it's people's ideological commitment to fossil fuel or anything else. I just think our political system has gone pretty dysfunctional, and who knows if we can rescue it. We're definitely going to try. We'll keep trying. But it's, you know, we are in a mess, and our energy system is one of the most obvious reflections of that mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah. I mean, in American history, these messes have not ended well. I'm thinking of our mistake of setting up slavery in this country, and what it took to get rid of it, and the absolute devastation that resulted in many parts of the country, you know, typically the South, but even in other places. I mean, it was very ugly getting rid of slavery, which was obviously at the time, even to many people, so wrong. And now again, burning fossil fuel seems very ugly and so wrong, and we don't seem to be able to get off this... what do you want to call it? A runaway train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Let's hope that, in this case, the fact that it's makes such eminent practical sense will eventually start to prevail. But yeah, you're right. The forces, the powerful forces lined up behind the status quo, are going to be tough to beat. They won't win in the long run. Thirty years from now, we're going to run the country and the planet on sun and wind, just because the economics is overwhelming. Look, the state that's putting up the most clean energy right now is the state of Texas, headquarters of the world hydrocarbon industry, because the economics are just so overwhelming. But if it takes us 30 years to get there, then you know, as well as I do, that the planet that we're running on, sun and wind will be a fundamentally broken planet. So let's try to make it happen a little sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: My guest is Bill McKibben, and his most recent book is called, &lt;em&gt;Here Comes the Sun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bill McKibben speaks at a Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline rally outside the State Department hearing at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C., 2011.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Let's drill down a little bit. People who might you know, want to say, "Well, is this guy McKibben, right?" What would you say to them who say, "But what about building solar fields or wind turbines in our backyards? I mean, we don't want to have that happen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: There's a lot of not in my backyard sentiment going around. Again, some of it's sponsored by the fossil fuel industry. They've done good work here. But much of it just based on that human desire to have everything stay the same. My state of Vermont, which I love, has had a de facto moratorium on wind turbines for 15 years now because people don't want to look at them. You know, sometimes I say to people, maybe our state motto should be change anything you want once I'm dead, you know. But we've got to get past that, and we should. I think wind turbines are gorgeous. I think seeing them against the horizon is a source of enormous beauty. Solar farms, one of the things we're starting to realize is that they're the sort of blank slate for an entirely new form of human endeavor that we're calling by the clunky name agrovoltaics, which means growing things in between rows of solar panels. What we've been growing near me in many places, are lots of pollinator friendly weeds and flowers, and the number of pollinating insects has increased by a factor of 100 in many cases, from what it was when these were agricultural fields. So the surrounding farmers get the benefit of that increased pollination. The birds get the benefit of all the bugs that are now there. It's, you know, it's taking a bite out of the biodiversity crisis at the same time as the climate crisis, but we do need to adjust our esthetic some and say this is what a responsible human settlement pattern looks like, and that's beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And what about electric vehicles? As I understand it, maybe one in five cars being sold around the world these days is electric, but here in the United States, I think it's got to be a 10th of that. Why do some people say that EVs are worse for the environment than gas and diesel fired ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: I think anybody who says that at this point is completely wrong. At this point, it takes a matter of a year or two before you pay back the energy investment on an EV. And this is where the whole rest of the world is going. You'll remember that 10 years ago, when we saw the lists of the most polluted cities in the world, they were all in China. None of them are in China anymore, and the rise of EVs has a lot to do with that. In fact, I've been talking to friends in Beijing and Shanghai this year who say that even compared with six months ago, not only is the air cleaner, but it is much, much, much quieter in those cities, because more than half the cars sold in China last month came with a plug hanging out the back. I don't know. You must drive an EV, Steve. They're way better cars than what they replace — quiet, nothing to break, very cheap to operate. You never have to go to a gas station unless you want a Diet Dr. Pepper or something. You know, it's just a much more elegant way to do things, in the same way that a heat pump is a lot more elegant than the oil furnace clanking away in your basement or the induction cooktop is a much better way of cooking than the open campfire in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Bill, to what extent is this EV thing a matter of testosterone? Because the one thing you know running an electric car, it doesn't go vroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Doesn't go vroom, but if you're really dedicated to going quickly, you know, my...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It's faster. Yes, it's faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: My, you know, 2019 Kia, can dust just about any internal combustion engine off the stoplight you can find. That's not my particular hobby. But if going fast is your thing, you know, the torque is immediate, applied directly. It's... these things jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="According to the International Energy Agency, more than 20% of new cars sold worldwide in 2024 were electric. (Photo: Ivan Radic, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_evcharger.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Bill, let's turn now to what's going on in the U.S. right now. I noticed that you were in New Jersey just a little while back. What were you doing there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Ah, this was great. It's part of this ongoing effort to pass what people are calling climate super fund laws, or polluter pays bills, or things like that. These are things already passed in Vermont and New York that would send a bill off to the oil industry for the damage that comes with climate change. On the argument that if anyone has to pay for new culverts and bridges and stuff after every flood, it shouldn't be the taxpayers. It should be the people who've been making huge profits off the fossil fuel that's driving these changes. So this year, New Jersey, California, and a number... Massachusetts, other places, are considering the same kinds of legislation. Really important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: How possible is it to get this legislation passed? I think famously, in New York, you guys had a big sitin outside the governor's office to get her to sign it at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bill McKibben speaks at the New Jersey Climate Superfund rally outside the Trenton Statehouse on November 17, 2025. This call to action supports legislation requiring major fossil fuel companies like Exxon, Shell, and BP to pay for damages from climate change impacts. (Photo: Alice Fruend)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_NJclimate.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Yes, we had to... we had to send to jail a number of us oldsters. I think, truthfully, this one should be a no brainer. I can't think why any politician would rather send their own taxpayers a bill for this stuff than send the bill to Exxon unless they're taking big contributions from Exxon, in which case maybe the equation changes. But if we got it through the, you know, political pit that is Albany, New York, I think it should be possible in a bunch of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Well, I mean that people are saying that this is going to raise energy bills and transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, it clearly doesn't raise the price of gas, because, as you know, the price of oil is set on the global market. It doesn't depend on, on, on what happens in New York. I mean, it depends on what happens if the next war breaks out, or the Suez Canal gets closed, or, you know, whatever. That's what sets the price of oil. The fact that New Yorkers are getting money back from Exxon doesn't affect it. Exxon, even Exxon doesn't set the price of oil. That's set on global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So on the back of this envelope here, I've scribbled some numbers that would indicate that if there are serious Cimate Superfund Laws that really assess for the damages, it would pretty much bankrupt Big Oil, these companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In 2014, Bill McKibben wrote an article for Rolling Stone magazine, entitled &amp;quot;A Call to Arms&amp;quot;, which invited readers to the “People’s Climate March” in New York City. (Photo: Southbend Voice, Flickr, CC BY SA 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_climatemarcharticle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Probably, if, I mean, if they, if, if we could really get them passed, and if the Supreme Court doesn't gut them and things. It would have the effect, I think, of beginning to push these guys in a direction of real negotiations. This is more or less what happened with the tobacco industry. States, one after another, began to sue them and win for the damage that they were causing to people's health the states were having to pay for, so the model is out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: But I mean, if the numbers really reflect the damage, can the oil companies afford this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: There's no amount of money to cover the damage that climate change is doing around the world. I mean, the last numbers that I saw anyone even attempt to do said that by the end of the century, climate change will be doing $551 trillion worth of damage, economic damage on the planet, which is literally far more money than exists on planet Earth at the moment. So, yeah, no, Exxon can't foot the whole bill, but if you could put some pressure on Exxon that forced them to start deciding they'd rather become a renewable energy company than a bankrupt oil company, that would be all to the good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Steve Curwood, and my guest is climate activist and author Bill McKibben. Bill, you’ve been doing this work for decades now. Talk to me about some of the triumphs that have kept you going through all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, for the first 35 years of this work, you know, we lived in a world where fossil fuel was cheap and renewable energy was expensive. So the job basically was to some ways drive up the cost of fossil fuel. People tried to do that with things like carbon taxes and carbon pricing that never really, at least in this country, took hold. So we also did things like try to prevent their expansion of their infrastructure and hence their consolidation of new territory. The Keystone Pipeline was a perfect example. When we started that fight, Canada was planning to quadruple, or quintuple, the amount of oil they were pumping out of the tar sands in Canada. By the time we were done, those dreams were much diminished. Similarly, we ran this massive ongoing fossil fuel divestment campaign that called on institutions to sell their stock in coal and gas and oil in order to make a moral stand, but also to raise the cost of capital for these companies. It's been the most successful anti corporate campaign in history. We're at about $40 trillion worth of endowments and portfolios that have taken those steps. So those things are ongoing. Now we've moved into this new world where the economics have flipped because sun and wind are cheaper than coal and oil and gas, and now our job, above all, is to figure out how to accelerate this transition. The force of economic gravity is working in our favor now. The fossil fuel industry, of course, knows this, which is why their resistance has stiffened. And so the fight is on. And I really think the fight is about what happens over the next four or five years because I think that's about how much window we have left to be making significant difference in what ends up happening with the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Depending on the math, you know, some 30% or so of climate changing emissions come from deforestation and degradation of forests, particularly the tropical forests. What do we need to do there to turn that around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, it's not a place where I'm the great expert, but it's pretty clear that we need to do the kind of things that say Lula has been doing in Brazil, which has dramatically slowed, again, the rate of deforestation in that part of the world. I think the worry is that we're now on a planet where that work is much physically harder because the rapid heating is reducing the ability of forests to sequester carbon and more and more and more, leading to their destruction. You know, the biggest forest loss in the last couple years have been these enormous fires across the boreal forests of Canada and Siberia. Canada, in 2023, was the fourth largest carbon emitting country on Earth, after the U.S., China and India. Despite its tiny population, just because its forests were on fire. Those boreal forests weren't supposed to burn. You know, they're too far north, too cold, too wet, but in the world we've created, they're tinder. So this is very, very, very hard place to be at work. I completely agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different kind of leader gives a different kind of speech by Bill McKibben&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/a-different-kind-of-leader-gives"&gt;Read on Substack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Bill, what are you up to these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, I spend a lot of my time volunteering at Third Act, which organizes, as I said, older folks like me, people over 60 for action on climate and democracy. And that... you know, climate and democracy are the two things most at risk, and we're pretty proud of the work that we're doing. We were really proud earlier this fall when Stephen Miller, the President's henchman, was giving reporters a tour of his newly militarized Washington DC, and boasting about all the National Guardsmen and tanks and stuff. And he said, "Our only problem is all these elderly hippies who keep coming out of their houses to scream at us. They should go home and take a nap." We immediately wrote him a letter saying we're not going home to take a nap. We're going to keep bedeviling you, because we think you're selling out the America that we've always known on democracy terms and on energy and climate and environmental terms. So that fight is what preoccupies me. I think the midterm elections this year will take up an enormous amount of that effort, and part of the way that we're going to win those elections is by helping people understand the huge possibilities that the sun is suddenly giving us to change our economies and our lives in benign and even beautiful ways. Look, if every Australian gets three free hours of electricity, what human being is going to look at that and not say, "Me too, please?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now you mentioned, of course, dealing with fossil fuels and also working for democracy. And here's the question, when it comes to China, you say China is really ahead of us and is moving quite strongly in this sector, but it's hardly a democracy. What is the risk of getting behind the Chinese model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The rise of electric vehicles in China has made the air cleaner and the roads quieter, says McKibben.

&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, I think that the... well, I mean, I completely agree with you. I'm well aware that if I'd spent my life in China doing what I've spent it doing in this country, I would have spent my life in prison, which is one of the reasons why it makes me so sad that we've just ceded technological and economic primacy to China. But I think the difference here is if you know the U.S. and Donald Trump has explained that we want energy dominance through sales of hydrocarbons to the rest of the world. If you end up buying oil and gas from U.S. or Russia or Saudi Arabia, you're just stuck with them forever. You're dependent on them. If you go buy some solar panels from China, it's a one time transaction, and after that, you don't have to give a fig about the Chinese, you know, because now you work with the sun directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: You know, Bill, given the current political situation here in the United States, where do you see an opportunity to get everyone pulling in the same direction towards a future powered by renewable energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, I don't actually think we're going to get everyone pulling in the same direction anytime soon. I think the fossil fuel industry is going to continue to pull in the wrong direction, and their economic might is enough that they'll bring too many politicians with them. I think that the rest of us, ordinary people, are going to have to do a lot of that pulling, and that's why things like Sun Day are so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So, Bill, anything you want to add to our discussion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bill McKibben serves as the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in Environmental Studies at Middlebury College and holds honorary degrees from 20 colleges and universities.

(Photo: StoryWorkz)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_profile.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: The only thing I'd add is that, you know, we've talked about the economic necessity of doing this and the climate urgency of doing this, but there's also just a certain amount of beauty that comes with it. You know, when we were getting ready to do Sun Day, one of the things we did was make a playlist of all the songs about the sun that there were. And I mean, obviously I stole the title of my book from George Harrison, which is the "Here Comes the Sun" is the most listened to Beatles song on the world's streaming services. There were hundreds of songs to choose from, which, by the way, is hundreds more than if you tried to compile a playlist of great songs about fracking. And the reason is that humans have a deep, deep connection to the sun. You know, we don't really know how prehistoric people thought, but all the piles of stone they left behind, like Stonehenge, point towards the equinox or the solstice as soon as people were in the business of making myths, the first thing they had to explain was how the sun rose over here, set over here, and got back over here again in the morning to rise again. And so there are 1000s of great stories about giant turtles or emus who swallow up the sun and vomit it forth in the morning. That's the you know, that's the great possibility here. I was in Rome in September with the new pope, who had summoned people over for a conference on the 10th Anniversary of Pope Francis's epic encyclical on global warming. The new pope, strangely normal American said, "Yes, we're going to continue this work that Francis set us on. In fact, next year, the Vatican will become the first fully solar powered nation on Earth, when they flip the switch on this big new solar farm they're finishing up outside Rome." And I...when it was my turn for my remarks, I just said, "I think this is fantastic. Let's henceforth concentrate on energy from Heaven, not from Hell." I think that's a useful mantra for the period ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="This year’s fall equinox, September 21, 2025 marked the first official Sun Day, a celebration of solar power and other forms of clean energy.

(Photo: Simone Salvo)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MCKIBBEN_equinox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: In other words, Bill, you're suggesting that the solution here involves some sort of a spiritual connection as well. It's not just technical or economic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCKIBBEN: Well, I mean, you can make a completely compelling and full case on economic grounds, and certainly on the practical grounds that we don't want to destroy the planet on which we depend. But I think that those are in tune, in this case, with a deep human affection for our local star, the most charismatic object in our corner of the universe. I don't think there's a human alive who doesn't involuntarily grin when the sun breaks out from behind the clouds and hits them in the shoulder blades. So, you know, here comes the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Around this time of year some animals need to keep their wits about them, lest they end up as a hunter’s trophy, dinner, or down jacket. So, at his home on the Connecticut coast, Living on Earth’s Explorer in Residence, Mark Seth Lender provides a seasonal refuge for hungry puddle ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unexpected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mallards &amp;amp; Red-breasted Mergansers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mallards are here. They are here every Fall. Common enough, we tend to name, dismiss, and fail to see how beautiful they really are. I am as guilty in this as anyone. If you fed the ducks when you were a kid these are the ducks you fed. And so did I. And I still do. Because, before our houses and our seawalls and driveways and ridiculous lawns that do not belong anywhere in the line of sight of salt spray, there would instead… be shallows. Of wild rice and grasses, and rocks and stones and green sea weed there for the mallards to eat. Instead we are here. And there is nothing to eat, or anyway, not much; for me feeding the mallards more than a memory is an obligation. Not bread, not popcorn which fouls up their insides. Seed. AS MUCH AS I CAN CARRY. Stored in galvanized barrels with heavy stones on the lids so that the winds of October and the storms that follow will not send them skittering like leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in this season, the gunners come. In flat bottomed boats. Behind impenetrable screens made of reeds. I understand and I would not forbid it. But for 54 mallards I feed at my seawall, more sometimes, sometimes a few less, I create a sanctuary. I visit there every day. And if I am not on time – their time - the drakes call out to me, loud, their mates are murmuring, at the first inkling of daylight when forms are no more than shadows and no colors reach the eye. Throughout the cold season I come. At that last half hour before the night gives way and the day begins, until the end when we no more hear the guns. The mallards move towards me, not away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-12/MSL_mallard.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High tide is early today. Full up to just below the top of the seawall. Much of the seed sinks down. I watch and wait, and the mallards dive to feed. Only some. Not all. A percentage that never grows nor diminishes. On high tide days. This is the third year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except - Mallards do not do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bird books – all of them - mallards are dabbling ducks, not diving ducks. And dabblers do not dive. We tend to ignore what we have been told can’t be. Yet here it is. The water is deeper, the natural grasses just like the seed I contribute are submerged more and more of the time. And in response mallards, male and female both have the learned the capacity to hold their breath, push with their feet, force their way to the bottom, and stay there! Seven, eight, nine seconds at a time! As the waters rise they will be the ones who prosper and survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Darwin laughs up his sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

Dan Gearino, clean energy reporter with our media partner Inside Climate news, speaks with Host Steve Curwood about the massive data centers that power AI, community pushback, and how the AI trend could put vital climate targets out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI or artificial intelligence can make it easy for us humans, but the computers behind it have to work very hard. In fact, to find the right word needed in an AI-generated document a computer might make 20 billion calculations, which takes a lot of energy. So, AI can conveniently summarize web searches or draft an email, but its huge appetite for power may make it harder to reduce global warming emissions from the electricity sector. By 2030 US data center energy use is projected to consume ten percent of all the energy of the grid. That's more than double current usage, according to the Pew Research Center, and climate friendly energy sources may not be able to keep up with the demand. Joining us now is Dan Gearino, a clean energy reporter with our media partner Inside Climate News. Dan, welcome back to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: Good to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Dan, when we hear the words “data center” getting tossed around, what exactly are we talking about here? What are the purposes of these places?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: So data center is kind of an umbrella term. When this started to really boom, a lot of what we were talking about was cloud computing. So that's Gmail, that's the photos that you store online, that's a whole bunch of those things. And we're talking about large buildings filled with computer equipment, usually with really small headcount, so very few employees. What we're seeing now is a whole different kind of data center, which are AI data centers, artificial intelligence data centers, and they are much larger, doing the calculations behind various AI applications. So it is a totally different product, different on a whole bunch of different levels, but it's still a bunch of computer equipment inside a gigantic building with a small headcount, so we can say data center, and it includes all that stuff. But it is important to understand that we're talking about different kinds of things. Also, as we look ahead to the near future, the share of the overall data center market that is AI is rising a lot. So the new construction next year and the year after, AI is dominating that, whereas AI was a relatively small share of the construction we've seen up to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_powerline.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So we're here to talk today about artificial intelligence data plants, AI plants. Just how bad for the climate are these AI data centers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: The climate concerns come from mainly the fact that these things use so much electricity. They also use a lot of water, but the electricity is a main concern. And deploy it on a large scale, you look at certain parts of the country, where you're going to see substantial increases in the amount of power plants they need. You're also going to see significant disruption in the economics of power plants, plants that would not have been economically viable before are going to be because the price of electricity is going to go up, because demand has gone up. An old coal plant that would not have been making money could conceivably be making money now. You can justify stopping old and dirty power plants from going offline. So just right down the line, this transition we were seeing to a cleaner power sector, this is a serious obstacle to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So where are the biggest data centers right now in the US? One taps the old Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, or they want to, well, they want to restart it, because it's so hungry for electricity. Where are the big ones right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: So the talk of reopening nuclear plants, those are for kind of future looking you know, those are things that haven't happened yet. As far as projects that are up and running, and if we talk about the market as it stands now, the largest concentration of these things is in Northern Virginia, just right outside of DC, and that's for a whole bunch of interesting historical reasons that have to do with just the development of the internet and development of businesses around the internet. The advantage of having this collection of early companies in the space meant that other companies in the space moved there, meant that the infrastructure was there for companies. But with each passing year, you're seeing other markets rise up, and they're not to the point that they're anywhere close to eclipsing Northern Virginia, but you're seeing markets like Columbus. Central Iowa and other parts of Iowa are an absolutely booming data center market. And a lot of times you can trace this back to the one big project that was viewed as successful, the one big project that showed other developers that this is how you can do it here, and it's a pretty easy development process. There is this kind of herd mentality with some of where these projects are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Because data centers draw enormous amounts of power, they may force utilities to keep fossil-fuel plants running longer in order to meet demand. (Photo: Larry D. Moore, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY SA 4.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_power.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And where was this one big project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: One example is in Iowa, which is one of the fast-growing markets. There is a Microsoft Project in West Des Moines, Iowa that was, at its time, just mind blowingly large. And that was a project that helped to solidify the idea of Iowa as a viable and formidable market for this stuff. You see this in Columbus. There are several just gigantic, Meta has a pretty big presence here. Others do as well. And you see this where a project comes in, a lot of times, because there's some infrastructure there already in terms of internet lines and in terms of access to electricity. And you see others build somewhere close to there, because they're looking for some of those same things. And you have the local government or the permitting regime there becomes familiar with these projects, and it's easier rather than going to some random new place. We aren't yet at a point where these super, super projects are still in the future, and it'll be interesting to see where the market is once some of those are closer to going online, because of course, we're at a moment where everyone's kind of holding their breath, wondering, what in the world is going to happen with this market? Because it does seem like an unsustainable market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Renewable energy like wind and solar are the largest source of new power generation. (Photo: Kenueone, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_renewable.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah, what about renewables for these AI data centers? I mean, we're building lots of renewables. They need lots of power. Why not just use renewables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: There will be lots of renewables used. What's needed is electricity, and this whole idea of speed to power is what people in this industry talk about. So you want to get power plants up and running as fast as possible. You want to get as much power available as possible. Wind and solar are going to be natural, big parts of that, or at least they should be, because this is happening at the same time that there is an administration in Washington that is creating all of these impediments to developing renewable energy, taking away some of the programs and tax incentives and just kind of generally being hostile to, in particular wind power. And wind power is a really important part of the renewable energy mix. So you have this kind of one two punch of drastically increasing the demand for power and making it so that it's more difficult to build the cheapest and the cleanest forms of power, which are wind and solar. You add those two factors up, and it's not good for the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now, Dan, we can't talk about energy use without talking about the power grid. The three of them, I guess in this country, we got the East, we got the West. And Texas has its own. They seem stretched pretty thin already. So as these data centers grow, what does that mean for the grid going forward, physically as well, as you know, the cost to us consumers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Due to the water and energy requirements of data centers in rural areas and near homes, they sometimes have drastically low approval ratings from neighboring towns and communities. (Photo: Parker Higgins, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_rural.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: It's interesting right now, how Texas' system, which has fewer barriers to entry, it's just easier to build there. It seems like that system works nicely for this moment where you need to add a ton of power quickly. The other regional grids, there are various other challenges where it's a little bit harder in some places, and it's a lot harder in other places, to the point where you could imagine some of these big data center projects, the only way they would be viable is if they are building power right next to them or within a really close distance of them, and the grid as a whole is built to be able to serve the public during times of peak demand, and that's actually only a few days a year. So you have an entire grid built for the hottest days of summer and the coldest days of winter. And if these large power users can find ways to ramp down when that demand is high, if these become this economic and power grid problem that creates the solution of improving flexibility in the system, that could be a really good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And how are various local communities responding to these plans to build data centers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: I think it's safe to say that data centers have about the lowest approval rating of just about anything. Wherever these are proposed, just about anywhere, there is community opposition. And what's fascinating to me is that this cuts across partisan lines. It cuts across income lines. In these complicated times, people can agree they don't want a data center anywhere near them, and this opposition is only going to grow. As you see data centers being built outside of some of the markets that are more used to these things, if you see them being built more in rural areas, more in new markets, the opposition is it's just about overwhelming. You're going to start to see projects that just don't happen because the opposition is too much, and you're going to see local governments not wanting these projects. So this is something that is an impediment on the path of development going forward, and I think it is a underappreciated factor that we need to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Many gallons of water must be pumped through data center cooling systems to offset the intense heat generated by constant computing. (Photo: John Mann, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY SA 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_gallons.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And why don't communities want these things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: There is a lot of talk in communities about just how it affects water supply, how it may affect power. If you're building kind of a greenfield project, this is an absolutely gigantic thing that might be built on a woods or on a ridge or in an area that people don't want to see a giant new project. Also because these things do not have many employees, it's a different calculation in terms of the economic benefits to the community. It's not like this is an auto plant with 2000 employees, or something like that. This is a very small number of employees, so you're asking a community to sacrifice a whole bunch of its open land and potentially have this development that is sucking up a ton of water and power, with possible negative ramifications for other people who live in the area and the economic benefits for everyone else. I'm sure there are some benefits, these projects pay property taxes and things like that, but it's not enough for people to think this is something that they want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Dan, before you go, if data centers are here to stay and we're looking for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, how do you see sustainable development taking shape in this industry? Where will we be in 2050?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dan Gearino is a clean energy reporter who writes for Inside Climate News, covering renewable energy and utilities. (Photo: Dan Gearino)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/DATA_gearino.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GEARINO: An important thing to remember is that for a solid decade, more than a decade before this recent boom in electricity demand, demand was pretty much flat. We had found various efficiencies through lighting, a whole bunch of different innovations to get more use from our existing electricity resources. And as a result of that, you saw the very most expensive and dirty electricity sources no longer be viable. You saw coal plants close. You saw a whole bunch of things that are good in the long run. We have shifted into a new era in which demand for electricity is super high, and in which inefficient and dirty power sources conceivably can make money because demand is incredibly high. That is very, very harmful for getting to anywhere close to net zero by 2050. It just doesn't work. The numbers don't work. And the way that you can get back on a path toward getting to net zero is to find ways to operate these data center systems more efficiently, to make it so they use much less power. Now, that kind of innovation is a natural part of the evolution of an industry. It could very well be that at some point, not far in the future, we realize there are ways to do this that are, use a lot less power and are much more flexible. That's what needs to happen. We're just not in that phase of development. But right now, based on what we know of what the power use of these things is, it is, it's pretty bleak in terms of imagining what this means for hopes for net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: On the line now from Porter Corners, New York, is Joe Bruchac, a Nulhegan Abenaki storyteller and poet who’s here with his reflection on gratitude for the gifts of the Earth. Joe, good to talk to you again. How you doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRUCHAC: Oh, I'm good, kwai kwai nidôbak, hello my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And what do you have for us today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRUCHAC: I have an original poem that I wrote. It's based on traditions among the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois people, and the Wabanaki, my own people, of giving thanks and acknowledgement for the gifts that we often take for granted that are all around us. It's called “Earth Prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EARTH PRAYER (Adapted from Haudenosaunee and Wabanaki traditions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this Earth is our first mother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we say Ktsi Wliwini, mina ta mina--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Thanks, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all our ancestors could see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the rain that falls, the air we breathe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the healing waters, the giving stones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our mother’s blood, our mother’s bones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are gifts we have been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2021-01-01/BRUCHAC_withhisflute.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have grown, have grown, have grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what does this Earth ask of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that it asks is that we never&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;take too much, always remember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to give back in equal measure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for those gifts we may take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also remember that we must&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;walk with care, always show kindness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to all those now here with us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sharing gifts of life and light,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;never forget those who share our breath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two-legged, four-legged, those with wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who swim or dig into the soil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the grass, the trees, all living things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the greatest to those too small&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as we continue on this circle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which has no beginning and no end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America is deep in a health crisis, with rising cancer incidence among children, according to the National Cancer Institute. And the CDC reports a majority of Americans now suffer from some form of chronic disease. Though concerns about the health crisis are not new, the Trump administration promised to address them through the Make America Healthy Again or “MAHA” commission chaired by Bobby Kennedy, Jr., who is also US Secretary of Health and Human Services. The MAHA movement includes concerns over health impacts from pesticides, and in 2018 Bobby Kennedy publicly supported a successful multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Monsanto by a groundskeeper who claimed he had contracted cancer from exposure to glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup. While the World Health Organization found glyphosate is a probable carcinogen in 2015, today the Trump Administration is asking the US Supreme Court to block a wave of further lawsuits against Bayer, which purchased Monsanto, saying the EPA has not found glyphosate can cause cancer. And there are also bills in Congress to block such lawsuits. Here to discuss the MAHA Commission’s recent actions on agrochemicals is Carey Gillam, an investigative journalist and the author of The Monsanto Papers: Deadly Secrets, Corporate Corruption, and One Man’s Search for Justice. Carey welcome back to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Thank you, thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So we're going to talk about MAHA today, the Make America Healthy Again. So first, what is the history of the Make America Healthy Again Commission. What made it come to life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Well, I think really that varies based on who you are talking to, right? I mean the formality of Make America Healthy Again and the Make America Healthy Again Commission came about through Bobby Kennedy, RFK Jr., Bobby Kennedy and his presidential campaign, and then when he was appointed to the Trump administration to head up HHS, they formally formed this commission, Make America Healthy Again, MAHA, you know, kind of a play on Make America Great Again, right the MAGA movement that is so associated with Trump. But for me, I think and many other people, this MAHA movement, this sort of distrust of big food, Big Ag, Big Pharma, this movement for cleaner living, cleaner food, pushing food companies to get rid of artificial dyes and to reduce chemicals in the foods, and you know, that's been going on for a really long, long time. So I certainly don't think it's new that people and groups have organized and come together. You know, I'm thinking of Moms Across America, for instance, as one group, but there have been an increasing number of people becoming aware of the health effects, the problematic health effects of all of these different things that are put into our food and that are put into our children's bodies, rising rates of chronic disease and cancers, and they have been increasing their voices and trying to make them heard over the years. I do think this is the first time I've really seen it translate into a pretty powerful political movement, and certainly we haven't seen it at this level in the White House or any other presidential administration. They're seemingly having some success. I think it really powered Bobby Kennedy into, and powered the Trump re-election, by having this kind of movement and association with Bobby Kennedy, who has been talking about these issues for many, many years himself. So I think it's just this joining of forces in this really unique moment and sort of ironic culmination where we have people who are really interested in trying to make our world healthier, aligned or cooperating or trying to coordinate with an administration that, in many ways, is working to make our world far less healthy and far more polluted and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/MAHA_SNAP.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So who are the people supporting MAHA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Well a recent poll that came out in the middle of October took a look at that, and they, you know, asked thousands of people, sort of what their participation was in MAHA and what their beliefs were, and they showed that 38% of parents, like across partisan lines, 38% identified as supporters of MAHA, which I thought was really surprising. Sixty two percent of them were Republicans, 17% Democrats and 34% independents, and not all of them aligned with MAGA necessarily, they were seen as distinct. So, you know, I think it's an interesting movement. A lot of people that identified with MAHA had different positions on vaccines, but when it came to food and food additives and children's health and concerns about chronic disease, these people were locked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Carey, from a food and chemical lens, just how unhealthy is America these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Oh my gosh, it's pretty bad. We have 76% of Americans now suffering from at least one chronic disease, and about half suffering from multiple chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: How is MAHA proposing to change agriculture and chemical regulation across the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Well, gosh, if you read the MAHA commission report, it covers a whole range of areas, you know, from childhood depression and use of cell phones and antidepressants and too much screen time. And there's a lot of things packed in there, food additives, chemicals in the food, types of food people are eating. But if you look at pesticides in agriculture, which is what we're looking at today here, in the initial report, they were really trying to focus on a couple of the pesticides that are known to be most dangerous, glyphosate and atrazine. Atrazine was just last month declared a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization. Both of these chemicals are used liberally in our development of food, production of food, the residues are found on our food. The MAHA Commission, in its early April report targeted those chemicals specifically and talked about a need to reduce pesticide use overall. In the most final report that came out in September, they eliminated all discussion of those pesticides, and in fact, talked about what a great job the EPA was doing in terms of regulating pesticides. So I think there's some wins and some losses so far in the MAHA commission, and we're not really sure yet how far we're going to, we're going to see this movement go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Common herbicides used in the United States include glyphosate, and 2,4-D. While there is no universal ban on products like glyphosate, some countries, states and localities have implemented their own restrictions citing health concerns.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So what's going on Capitol Hill to really reduce the exposure of these chemical companies to getting sued by consumers. What are they trying to do legislatively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Yeah, it's a huge, huge push by the agricultural industry led by Bayer, a company that bought Monsanto in 2018. Bayer has formed the Modern Ag Alliance, they've pulled together dozens and dozens, they say, about 100 different ag organizations, and they are heavily lobbying Congress. They're marching around Capitol Hill, talking to legislators. A lot of money is flowing, a lot of advertising, trying to pass not only state laws, but get language into the farm bill and into appropriations and standalone bills to try to essentially, any way they can, to get legislation passed that would block consumers from being able to sue over a failure to warn, over the labeling. They're saying, we shouldn't be required to put anything on a label. Consumers shouldn't be able to sue us as long as the EPA has approved the product and approved the label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: The State of California, course, has been fairly aggressive on going after some of these chemicals. To what extent is this legislation aimed at telling California, “shut up”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: I think they really want California to shut up, right? California has been very aggressive on many fronts, right, and trying to restrict and control and to better understand where and how and how much pesticides are being used. This would preempt, you know, state moves, localities, states, counties, would preempt a lot of things that are trying to be done outside of Washington, DC to try to better protect people from pesticide use. This is what the companies say they need. I mean, Bayer is telling us and telling lawmakers, that if you don't protect us from lawsuits, if you don't protect us from restrictions on our chemicals, we're not going to sell them anymore and if we don't sell them anymore, farmers won't be able to grow enough food, people will go hungry, grocery prices will rise, calamity will rain down upon us all. They're saying these things are essential to feed the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Oats are among the many products grown in the United States sometimes sprayed with glyphosate. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons, Bill Ebbesen, Free Use)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/MAHA_oats.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It's ironic, isn't it, that a lot of American commodity crops can't be sold in many places because some countries tend to be more stringent on what chemicals they allow to be used on crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Yeah, there are many countries around the world that have restrictions, import bans, on bringing things in that might have residues of different pesticides on them, GMO crops as well. You know, there are a lot of countries that really don't want what the US is selling, which is why the US is such a very important market for these pesticide companies to protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now there's also what's called the Pesticide Accountability Act, introduced by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. What does this legislation champion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Well, Cory Booker essentially tried to flip the you know, script on these people and embed it into law that people could sue that this was a fundamental right, that people could try to hold these companies accountable. He hasn't gotten very far with that, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: You know, I believe the Trump Administration has approved new pesticides, including a couple of PFAS, and that the EPA, of course, has fired thousands of scientists from the Office of Research and Development, which looks at the impact of chemicals on human health and rolled back some programs at the USDA. I mean, talk to me about these actions and where they fall within the overall MAHA commission plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="According to the Environmental Working Group’s 2019 analysis of US Department of Agriculture data about 70% of fresh produce sold in the US has pesticide residues on it even after it is washed. (Photo: Flickr, Liz West, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-12-05/MAHA_veg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Yeah, it really is paradoxical to see this movement, MAHA and Kennedy trying to address, why are our children sicker? Why are we sick? You know, how are we going to make America healthy again? How are we going to make our food healthy and our environment? And at the very same time, you have the Trump administration, as you said, sort of rolling back, making the environment much more dangerous for our children. They're not only introducing or approving new pesticides, but they are rolling back regulations on clean air, you know, tracking air emissions. They're rolling back clean water rules. They're allowing for more CAFOs, more runoff, toxic runoff from large, confined animal operations, more pesticide discharge into waterways. They say they're doing this in the name of helping business and helping the economy and spurring growth and jobs, but they're, you know, there's just a lot of concern out there that what they're doing is just making the environment much more deadly and toxic for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Carey, you've been reporting on the agrochemical industry for years. From your perspective, why is it so hard to regulate chemicals in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: So many reasons, right? I think the thing that comes to my mind most immediately is just the corruption that we've seen, the collusion, the corruption, the power that the agricultural industry wields over the EPA, wields over lawmakers. We have, is it four or five now, I can't keep track of industry officials, agricultural industry leaders who have been brought in now under the Trump administration to help run the EPA and help oversee what chemicals are going to be approved or not approved. These are people who've worked in the industry for their whole lives, pushing these chemicals, and they're now sitting in our top regulatory authority. And that's not new to the Trump administration. We've seen that over and over and over again, the sort of revolving door of people coming in and people coming out, and we have so many internal documents and messages from company leaders to EPA leaders, talking about how they're going to work together, you know, and Monsanto, the famous memos about talking about the EPA official who oversaw glyphosate, being a real friend and being someone who was helpful to them, and their defense of glyphosate. We got numerous whistleblowers who've come out of the EPA saying they won't let us publish true science, they're corrupting our science, they're hiding information about harmful effects of these chemicals. I mean, it's a corrupt agency, as I think corruption runs through many of our federal agencies, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Glyphosate is a common ingredient in chemical herbicides and widely used in commercial agriculture. (Photo: Jeff Vanuga, NRCS)" src="https://loe.org/content/2018-05-18/GLYPHOSATE-pesticide-spraying-on-row-crops.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Stepping back a distance, what about the concept of chemical regulation in this country? In many places around the world, there is the precautionary principle to not approve chemicals unless you can prove that they are safe. In the United States, I believe it's the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: A chemical is considered innocent unless and until it's proven guilty. How well is that system working for us do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: You're right. I mean, I mean, I think you've explained it very well. There is much more a precautionary approach overseas, in Europe and other countries. Let's prove it's safe before it's on the market. Here, it's presumed to be safe. The companies bring in all of their scientific studies, and they say, here, we've shown this to the EPA, this is safe, let's go ahead and approve it, and in the majority of cases, they do. Our federal law does require that when they look at doing any sort of regulation of a pesticide, that they take into account the economic impact of that chemical being on the market, the jobs that it creates, you know, all of the money that farmers will be spending and pesticide companies will be getting and the yields that farmers will get from it. So that's sort of at the heart of it, and I think that that's been a real problem too, because you do have chemicals that have been out there, used on our food, used in farming, that have been shown for years, decades, to be dangerous to our health in scientific studies. And then you'll see, like in the case of chlorpyrifos, and it will take so long until the EPA eventually says, yeah, I guess we should do something about that, you know, but we'll have this chemical on the market for years and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: You've been in contact with a number of the voices within the MAHA movement. I'm thinking of Zen Honeycutt, the Executive Director of Moms Across America, what's been their reaction to the Commission's involvement with the big ag industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Well, a lot of them, you know, were very disappointed, of course, angry, frustrated when the MAHA commission sort of kneeled, bowed down to the agricultural industry, editing out the criticism of pesticides in its final report that came out in September. They were not happy with that at all, but I don't know that they're deterred. I think it, you know, just means they're saying they have to work a little bit harder and they're keeping at it. The first round might have gone to the agricultural industry, but they certainly are not giving up the fight yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Carey Gillam is an investigative journalist and the author of the Monsanto Papers: Deadly Secrets, Corporate Corruption and One Man's Search for Justice. Carey, thanks so much for taking the time with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GILLAM: Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: We reached out to the Trump Administration and the Make America Healthy Again Commission for comment but did not receive responses in time for this broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Wall Kimmerer is perhaps best known as the author of Braiding Sweetgrass, about living in a reciprocal relationship with other beings and the gifts of the Earth. And in her 2024 book, The Serviceberry: Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World, she focuses on gift economies. You might encounter gift economies in your daily life – Buy Nothing groups on Facebook, community fridges where people share food with neighbors, or the little free libraries down the street. Robin Wall Kimmerer is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi nation and professor of environmental biology at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and she joins us now. Hi Robin, and welcome to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Hi, Jenni, thanks for the invitation to join you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So what is a serviceberry, and why is it significant to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: A serviceberry is a beautiful genus of plants. It doesn't look like much. In fact, I tell my students, you can tell a serviceberry because it's kind of generic looking in that the leaves are just round, smooth, gray bark. But when it flowers and fruits, it's a whole different story. In the springtime, there's just a froth of white blossoms, and then in mid-summer, it's just heavily laden with these red, juicy fruits. You can mostly find it around edges of water, edges of trails. It's an ecotone species that kind of likes the forest edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Mm. And it sounds like it brings this abundance in season, when these berries are ripe, all kinds of animals and people, including yourself, enjoy these berries. So what does that abundance of serviceberries lead to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Well, the abundance of serviceberries leads to an abundance of life all around because, for example, in the early spring, there's a whole group of bees that rely entirely on those early spring flowers, right? So it's feeding the pollinator community. And then later, when the berries start to ripen, oh, you can find a serviceberry tree, because of all the birds, they are all just gathering there, and they're so noisy. I use them for prospecting. That's how I find a serviceberry tree is I listen for the birds, so it's feeding that whole community as well. You know, those are the obvious ways that it's engaged, but it's also an important host for lots of different larvae of butterflies and the whole food web that grows around this tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And you yourself describe in this book, harvesting, putting those berries into a pail, and then being able to share that abundance with your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: That's right. They are so abundant that on my neighbor's farm, where they plant the Western variety of serviceberry known as saskatoons, they are just an exemplar of abundance. You can just pick them by the handful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-11-22/SERVICEBERRY_fruit2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And you can turn them into a pie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Oh, they make a good pie. They make good jam, good syrup. But you know, traditionally, a lot of native cultures, particularly Western cultures, used, it's the source of pemmican. It's the major fruit for pemmican. So the berries would be dried and pounded into this really super food. The berries are really rich in antioxidants and vitamin C. So it was an excellent choice to mix into the original energy bars, which were pemmican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And, pemmican, remind me is that a mix of berries and meat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: It is, yeah, the berries are dried and pounded, and elk or venison is also dried and pounded, and then the whole thing is bound together with rendered fat. So it is quite literally the original energy bar, and our people used it for travel food and for trade, etc. It was a really important way to store excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Tell me about the connection here between this idea of a gift economy and the way that resources are shared in the natural world. Could you maybe trace the path of a serviceberry for us? Maybe the berry itself falls to the ground or gets eaten by a bird, and what happens next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A portrait of Robin Wall Kimmerer, author of  *The Serviceberry,*  reflecting her deep connection to nature and ecological knowledge. (Photo: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-11-22/SERVICEBERRY_robin.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Well, I think it's important to preface that by talking about what I mean by “gift.” And a gift in my thinking, and this reflects a lot of ancestral teachings, a gift is something that we have not earned, and yet it comes to us, someone bestows it upon you. So let's follow the thread that you suggest, Jenni, of the growth of a serviceberry. The sun, the sun is the energy that animates all of it, and so all of that sunshine, through photosynthesis, turns into the body of the serviceberry. One could argue that the sun, the sun's energy, is a gift. We have not earned it, and yet it comes. But that gift of photosynthesis is then shared with others. It's shared with the larvae of those caterpillars that are eating the leaves. It's shared in the abundance of fruits that the robins and the cedar waxwings and the blackbirds are all coming to feast on. The gift is shared. It's passed on. And then, of course, those birds that are splattering bird poop all over the ground, all of that nitrogen, right, is feeding the food web below ground and building soil. The fox that comes and snatches one of those robins off the ground while it's all full of berries, the gift stays in motion. And so if we start with the premise that what life produces for us is a gift, it's all a gift economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: In the book, you quote an indigenous Brazilian hunter saying, "Store my meat? I store my meat in the belly of my brother." Can you tell me the story of that quote?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The serviceberry fruit, sweet and tart, supports pollinators and birds, playing a vital role in ecosystems. (Photo: Unsplash, public domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-11-22/SERVICEBERRY_fruit.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Yes, that quote, that story that was shared by an anthropologist, linguist working with Amazonian indigenous peoples, is at the heart of what we understand to be a gift economy. In this story, the hunter had been successful that day and came back with a really sizable animal. And so the anthropologist linguist was talking with them and saying, "Well, how are you going to store the meat? Are you going to dry it or salt it? What will you do to store the meat?" And he reports the astonishment of the hunter, saying, "Store my meat? Why would I do that?" And so he asks again, and he said, "Well, no, I don't store my meat. I store my meat in the belly of my brother." Meaning he wasn't going to hold on to and accumulate this bonus, this surplus of meat. He was going to have a feast. He was going to invite his neighbors, his friends, his extended family, all to come and benefit from what the forest had provided him in the form of game. And the anthropologist was astonished because that breaks all the rules of Western economics, doesn't it, that says, "Well, you should hold on to that for yourself. You should store it so that when the hungry time comes, as it inevitably does, you'll have food security." But essentially, the lesson taught by that story is there are other ways to have material security, food security, and that is through relationship. That hunter was saying, when I feed my neighbors, when I feed my community, they're going to feed me when their nets are full of fish, they're going to invite me to a feast if I need their help. We've established good relationships of trust and kinship, so they'll take care of me, because I'm taking care of them. And that is the heart of a gift economy. No money is exchanged. The gift stays in motion. It creates this network of relationships that create the kind of material security that market economics is designed to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And in our own lives, what advice do you have for centering gift economies, participating in those, and reciprocity in our lives while also living in this modern world, this complex world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Before it bears fruit, the serviceberry plant is characterized by its delicate white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators. (Photo: Unsplash, public domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-11-22/SERVICEBERRY_flower.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Well, the book is full of examples of micro scale gift economies. Some of the ones that seem most appropriate to think about in a time of climate crisis. What is it that's driving the climate crisis? It's hyper consumption, overconsumption, and gift economies suggest, you know what? We don't all need to own everything that we need in life. We don't need to each go out and buy a lawnmower. We don't. We need, perhaps one for the neighborhood. And those kinds of neighborly sharing help to stem hyper consumption, but you also create a web of mutual relationship, which I think as human people, particularly in an industrialized society, we crave. We crave that sense of belonging, of being known, of being needed in our communities. So that's how I think about the role of gift economies as a sharing economy that produces abundance without market regulation. And so I think gift economies can live in coexistence with the dominant model of economics, if we encourage them. And I don't want in any way this idea of trying to promulgate small, highly localized gift economies to in anyway excuse us from rethinking capitalism and damage associated with it. In the book, I talk quite a lot about the ethical jeopardy of extractive systems and the cost that that has in the well-being of the planet, and while we could celebrate and cultivate small scale gift economies, that doesn't mean we aren't still complicit with this larger system that we need to seriously rethink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Can you describe for me scaling up this gift economy idea and how we can kind of work with this complex, global, interconnected world that we have, and integrate some more of this gift economy thinking into that system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: You know, I began looking for gift economies in modern society after having learned about them from both ancestral and contemporary indigenous societies, and I found them everywhere, once you kind of know what to look for. One of the examples that I like to start with is, you know, when you read a good book, you want to pass it on to a friend. You don't sell that book to your friend. You give it to them. There it is a tiny, little gift economy. But how does that scale up? Well, in my neighborhood, we have little free libraries where people say, oh, let's leave our books here to share with one another. That's a gift economy. I think about public libraries as gift economies. We don't own the books. That's the idea. We have abundance of literature because we share. So that continuum from the giving a book to a friend, to little free libraries to public libraries, gives us a hint at what gift economies can look like. And at a larger scale, the way that we use our financial resources to invest in commons, common resources, like libraries, offers us an opening as well. What about things like common lands of parks and trails and water? Those are things we don't each of us own. We care for them in common. We enjoy them in common. So gift economies are also an invitation to the economy of the commons, rather than of private property and individual ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Before you go, Robin, in this season of harvest, how does giving thanks connect with abundance and reciprocity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIMMERER: Gratitude is such an important human response to the abundance of the world and deep gratitude. No, I don't mean just like that polite toss off thank you. I mean the kind of gratitude where you recognize that your life is totally dependent upon the lives of other beings, that you would not exist without water or those berries or that medicine, that kind of deep gratitude that allows us to look at the world of abundance and feel as if you have everything that you need. Let's be clear, everything that I need might be quite different than everything that I want. But everything that I need, I have and is provided for me as a gift from Mother Earth. It also makes you feel as if you have everything, and so why do you need to buy anything else? It creates a sense of sufficiency and “enoughness” that puts the brakes on consumption. I believe eco-psychologists have demonstrated that people who practice gratitude consume less than people who don't. To think about the world as gift is to think about the world not as objects that belong to us, but as stories. That shirt that you might want to buy, it's not just as an object, is it? It's the product of many hands, and it has consequences. It has costs. And so I think one of the most important things we can do as consumers is to really think about the stories associated with those objects. Was that fiber in the shirt that you're interested in, is it recycled? Is it part of a circular economy, or is it part of an extractive economy? And when we see the world as gift, we see that whole story of knowing where everything came from, and then that's what helps something be a gift, not a commodity, is we know all the relationships that are associated with it. But that same attention to the story of an object allows us to decide whether we're going to buy it or not. Are we going to participate in a dishonorable harvest, or are we only going to purchase those things which safeguard life, make life better?&lt;/p&gt;

A September 2025 study published in the journal Nature found that every year around 40,000 Americans are dying from wildfire smoke, with more on the way as the planet warms. Senior author Dr. Marshall Burke, a professor in the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University, joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss how air filters, face masks and low-intensity prescribed burning can help protect the public from this growing threat.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And I’m Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our show today focuses on fire, including the growing threats our society faces from extreme wildfire as the planet warms. But fire is a creative as well as destructive force, so we’ll spend time later in the show discussing the roles of fire in ecology and culture, as well as how we can help each other heal and recover from the collective trauma of living through these megafires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, and it really is a collective trauma for many here in the U.S. I mean, whether or not you’ve found yourself in the direct path of a wildfire, chances are you have been in the widening path of wildfire smoke and experienced the scratchy throat, coughing, and burning eyes that exposure can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Yeah, you know Jenni, I certainly remember a lot of extra throat clearing when we’ve recorded this show during some of those really smoky days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yes, me too. Wildfire smoke has become extremely noticeable anecdotally but also in the scientific data. And a September 2025 study published in Nature quantifies just how deadly that smoke can be in a warming world. The researchers found that around 40,000 Americans are dying from wildfire smoke every year, with more on the way as the planet warms. Here to talk to us about the study is senior author Dr. Marshall Burke, a professor in the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. Hi Marshall, and welcome to the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: Hi, thanks so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So we're talking to you about your recent research regarding the link between wildfire smoke and mortality. Talk to me about what kinds of questions you were asking and what you found about how smoke is killing us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: People have a sense that breathing in smoke is bad for them. We set out to understand, okay, how bad is it actually? And we looked at really, one of the most severe outcomes, so thinking about excess mortality, and wanted to understand how exposure to wildfire smoke in the days or weeks or even years past an exposure, how that affected excess mortality, the likelihood that you would die. And unfortunately, we see pretty large effects. We see that in the year of smoke exposure, mortality goes up substantially, and those effects last for multiple years. So the largest impacts, in terms of people affected and overall impacts, they're larger in the US West, because exposures tend to be higher. But again, in the last few years, we've just seen a lot more exposure elsewhere in the country, and so people on the East Coast and the Midwest, increasingly in the US South are exposed to wildfire smoke. And so when you count up total mortality across the US, we get a number of about 40,000 excess deaths per year from wildfire smoke over the last decade. Forty thousand, that's roughly on par with the number of people who die in car accidents in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/SMOKE_crbox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And then you also projected out these numbers into the future because, you know, we know that these wildfire risks are probably not going to decrease in the coming decades. They may, in fact, be getting worse as climate change intensifies. So what did you find there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: That's right. We wanted to understand whether this was the new normal and how it might change in the future. And here, we really built on decades of work showing why we were seeing an increase in wildfire activity and smoke overall. And really there, there are two main causes. One is a century of fire suppression, where we've put out fires instead of let them burn in our forests. Many forests had evolved with fire. We sort of interrupted that about a century ago, and what that led to was a loading of fuels in these forests. So I go hiking in the Sierra Nevada a lot. You go into many of these forests, and there's just an incredible amount of dead wood and fuel on the ground in these forests. You add on top of that a warming climate. These fuels dry out. They become more flammable. And so, when you do get a spark, the fires grow much more quickly. They're much more extreme, and they emit a lot more smoke. So we know from climate models that the climate will continue to warm in the future. And so we were able to model out, okay, what's going to happen over the next 20, 30, years in terms of expected wildfire activity and expected smoke output. And sure enough, as the climate continues to warm, under a business-as-usual scenario where we sort of behave as we have over the last few decades, in the future, we find a pretty substantial increase in smoke exposure and resulting health burden. So we estimate that, you know, again, we're at 40,000 deaths annually now. This could rise to 70,000 deaths by 2050, so like a 70% increase in the health burden just over the next two to three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Our guest, Dr. Burke suggests wearing an N95 mask if you have to go outside on a day when there is bad air quality. (Photo: Debora Cartagena, Wikimedia Commons, Public domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/SMOKE_respirator.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow. I imagine that's not just from population increases either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: No, it's not just from population increases, although that does play a role. Another important role is the aging of the population. So we certainly find that elderly groups are more susceptible and more vulnerable to wildfire smoke, and so as our population ages, that certainly makes us as a society, more vulnerable. So that's part of the story. The main part of the story, though, is just the overall warming climate, the resulting increase in fire activity and smoke exposure that we get. So what we can do is we can take those total deaths that we spoke of, so 70,000 deaths by 2050, we can do what economists are happy doing, what other people understandably view as sort of insane. But we can convert these deaths to dollars using the official US government number of how much a statistical life is worth, which is about $10 million. And if you do that multiplication, you get many hundreds of billions of dollars of damage every year from wildfire smoke alone. Our estimate is that that is the largest single impact of climate change in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow. All right, I was already blown away by your research. And how about if we get our act together on climate and really reduce our emissions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: So unfortunately, by mid-century, we find that even pretty aggressive climate mitigation, so if we really get our act together and reduce emissions, that will have a benefit. But the benefits, at least by 2050, in the next few decades, are pretty small. And the reason for that is just that climate change is a very slow ship to turn. And so if we reduce our emissions today, that can have massive benefits, but most of those benefits are later on in the century. So by 2050, there are certainly benefits, but they're just not as large as what you get by 2070 or 2080 or end of the century. We find sort of a small difference, so maybe 60,000 or low 60,000 deaths under a very aggressive mitigation scenario, versus about 70,000 under a business as usual. So certainly a benefit, but it doesn't eliminate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fire consumes low-level brush during the 2025 NASA FireSense research campaign, centered around prescribed burn operations at Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.

&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow. So I guess we all better be a little more prepared for what's coming and what's already here, to be honest. So as wildfire smoke poses this increasing public health threat what are individuals doing to protect themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: I think there's two questions: What are individuals doing to protect themselves, and what should they be doing to protect themselves? So this is something our group has looked at, is to try to understand what are people doing now to protect themselves? One way we've studied this is to use really nice citizen science data, basically data that are available to us based on individual citizens, just out in the population, collecting data, either on purpose or inadvertently. So specifically, we use these purple air monitors that many people have put in their homes that serve data publicly that we can then as scientists analyze. What we can do is look at people's indoor air concentrations on wildfire smoke days, so on days in which the smoke outside is really bad, to understand, is it sufficient to stay inside and close your windows and doors on a really bad wildfire smoke day? This tends to be the main public guidance. The air is bad outside, stay inside, close your windows and doors. So we can look at people's monitors and say, "Okay, how well are they doing?" These are indoor monitors. What are the pollution concentrations? And these are people with monitors, right? So these are people who should have very good information on what their exposure is. Basically we see two groups. We see one group that seems to be doing something well, their indoor air quality looks quite good on a smoky day. We see it basically the other half of the group where the opposite is true. Their indoor air quality can be almost as bad as the outdoor air quality on a really bad smoke day. And these are in pretty wealthy Bay Area neighborhoods, like these are my neighbors down the street. And so the question is, what's going on? And almost surely, what's happening is they have windows and doors that are open, and so wildfire smoke is infiltrating into these environments. And these are people with monitors. They're the ones who should be best informed about this exposure, right? So that tells us, at least right now, we are not super well-prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The aftermath of the January 2025 fires in Altadena, CA.

&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So what really should people be doing? I mean, obviously, closing windows, trying to keep doors closed as much as possible when there's a lot of smoke around. But I mean, is there anything else that we should be doing, especially when we do have to go outside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: Yeah, there's a number of things we can do. And the science is still catching up in terms of the overall health benefits of these strategies, but there's some things that look pretty promising. Number one, closing your windows and doors is certainly the place to start, but the key thing is having an ability to filter your air indoors. So these can be portable air filters. They cost, typically, a few hundred dollars. You can build them yourself with fans and a MERV filter for about $50. And these work really well, if they're sized correctly, work really well to keep air quality pretty clean indoors, even if it's bad outdoors. And so that is our main strategy, if you're inside, for improving air. So what we need to make sure, though, is that, number one, people have this technology and know when to use it. And number two, you know, everyone can afford it. Many of us can go out and spend a few hundred dollars on an air filter. Others can't. And so, we need to make sure, using public policy that everyone has access to this technology. That's number one. Number two, many people do have to work outside. Many of us have to go outside in various parts of our lives, and so we need to protect ourselves as best we can when we're outside as well. Wearing a good-fitting N95 mask can help a lot. And so we have those masks. They might be buried in a drawer now, but dig them out on a wildfire day, put them on as best you can. You can't wear them always. If you're doing heavy activity, they're obviously hard to wear. Our goal is probably not to eliminate exposure, it's to reduce exposure as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Marshall Burke is a senior author on the study and a professor in the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. (Photo: Courtesy of Dr. Marshall Burke)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/SMOKE_burke.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So if we do everything in our power to address the climate crisis, the conditions that lead to extreme wildfires will still be with us for a long time. So it makes sense. We need to thin these fuels. Prescribed fire can be one way to do that. That, of course, is creating smoke. But to what extent is there a difference between that smoke and the really intense burning that we're seeing with some of these out-of-control wildfires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURKE: Yeah, that's a great question. There's two main components of the difference. One is, is the smoke itself somehow different in terms of its toxicity? So when we think about wildfire smoke, we're really thinking about a really broad and complicated mix of pollutants and chemicals and toxins, potentially. And unfortunately, they are toxic chemicals you get when you get increasing urban incursion of wildfires, right? When wildfires burn into cities and towns, and they burn up our houses, everything that's under our sink or in our garage. They burn up cars or bicycles. And so when you inhale that wildfire smoke, you're inhaling part of a car, right? And what does that do to you? It certainly can't be good. And again, this is a place where science is, I think, trying to catch up in terms of understanding the toxicity. To me, that's not the most important difference. The most important difference is just the overall quantity of the smoke that you get. And the whole goal with prescribed fire is to put low severity fire on the ground that really doesn't generate that much smoke in the hopes of reducing really extreme wildfires that we know generate a lot of smoke. Our estimate suggests that the reduction in smoke you get is three to five times higher than the initial smoke that you emit from prescribed burning. So to us, that looks pretty good from a cost benefit perspective. Again, it's a tradeoff, though you are going to get some smoke initially, and people need to be aware of that. And they need to be, I think, educated about the tradeoffs. This is indeed a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Dr. Marshall Burke is senior author on the study and a professor in the Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. Thank you so much, Dr. Burke.&lt;/p&gt;

One such practice comes from the Métis tradition in Western Canada.

&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: To combat increasingly dangerous wildfires, modern fire management teams may use prescribed burns to reduce fuel buildup before fire season begins. But around the world, Indigenous people have been using fire on the landscape for thousands of years. One such practice comes from the Métis tradition in Western Canada. While a prescribed burn is typically a larger, low to moderate-intensity fire, the Métis burning practice is much smaller, more closely resembling a campfire, and it carries cultural significance. To learn more, we turn now to Cree-Métis scientist Dr. Amy Cardinal Christianson. She's a senior fire advisor with the Indigenous Leadership Initiative. Amy, welcome to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Hi there. Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So tell us, how did you get involved in this world of fire stewardship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: I just remember growing up having lots of my family involved in firefighting. Back then you know, we had fires all the time, but they weren't like scary fires. But I’d never actually really thought much about it until I moved down south to an urban center, and then I realized that that wasn't really like a normal life experience for a lot of people. And then I started really working with Métis elders during my PhD and just started hearing this concept of “cleaning the land.” And really got interested in rediscovering my own family's role in use of fire, but then also just how this could be a, you know, a potential solution for our current wildfire crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Now, many of us might be familiar with this concept of “prescribed burn.” How would you say that is both similar to or different from a Métis or Indigenous burning practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yeah, so you know what, they're both very important practices but they're also like apples and oranges and so lots of people use the two terms interchangeably, but really they're very different conceptually, like for Indigenous people, like when we use cultural fire, it's around Indigenous governance systems and knowledge of when to burn, and it's done to achieve cultural objectives on the landscape, so things that we need to sustain our cultures. There's hundreds of reasons why Indigenous people burn. I mean, I think some of the most common and shared are, you know, burning for berries. So for example, berry bushes often get overgrown as they age, and when we go in with fire in the early spring or late fall, it's almost like pruning those berry bushes. You kind of burn the dead parts of them that aren't producing, but you leave the roots intact. So then the next spring, they put up really healthy new growth. And then for cultures that rely on bears, the bears are attracted to the new berry growth. So it almost like lures the animals into that area. And then in the end of the summer, you know, you get really nice fat bears to harvest. Prescribed fire is done for quite a different reason. It's usually to reduce hazard, so to, you know, remove vegetation and other things. It also generally follows quite a paramilitary approach. You know, it's dominated by white men, and, you know, there's lots of equipment and helicopters and, I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. The fires that they're doing are usually higher risk than the cultural burns that we do. So they're both very important practices, but just quite different in how they're actually carried out on the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: How did colonization change burning practices across Canada?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yeah, so when settlers first came to Canada, they saw trees back then as money signs, right? They didn't understand, you know, why you would want to potentially burn in an area. So they brought these fire exclusion policies, and the first one in Canada was actually in 1610, in Newfoundland. So that made Indigenous burning illegal. And then there was also, like, the campaign of systemically removing Indigenous people from their lands. So through the Indian Act we have in Canada, through putting people onto reserves, through residential schools, all of those things basically led to this huge severance of our knowledge systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And what kind of pushback have you faced against these cultural burning practices over the years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: You know, there's all sorts of Acts and regulations and other things in place right now that keep us still from burning as we need to do on the landscape. Even amongst our communities, there's a reluctance or a fear of fire, because we've been told for so long that that's not an appropriate practice to carry out on the land. So I think for me, you know, that's been one hard thing to watch, because we need fire. We need fire on the landscape, and what these out-of-control fires are showing us is that we're not stewarding forests properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I'm curious how you would say your participation in burns is tied to or influenced by your relationship with the forest or nature just on a general level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yeah, you know, I think that it's implicitly tied. Because if you don't have that relationship, you don't understand why fire would be needed, and you don't understand then how that vegetation and other things might respond to fire. Like, one thing that's really important for us when we're using fire is, you know, thinking about nesting birds and other things, if we know that they're there we don't want to burn that area, right, because we're basically burning up their nests. So there has to be, like, that cultural tie to the landscape. When I go burn too, like, usually I go with my husband and my kids, it usually takes us two or three hours, so kind of an afternoon activity. We don't use, like, a ton of water, anything, because we have, like natural fire breaks, like snow lines or other things there. Actually, my daughters, I think, kind of find it boring, like after you like light it, because it's like a very, very controlled activity. And so that's one thing I often hear as a criticism for cultural burning is that, like, there's no training required, or there's no planning required, and that's incredibly insulting, because for us, like the training comes from, you know, years of working with people who are more knowledgeable than us with fire, and then, you know, the planning is done endlessly. It's something that we're constantly looking at and observing the land as we decide when and where to put fire. The positive side is, you know, that I just love being out there, and just because cultural burning is a slow activity you like, here are the birds, you notice the trees. Like, I'm pretty familiar with most trees on my property, which I know people might think is crazy, but like, I know, like, you know, I can see them and I can tell if they're like sick or if things are, are different about them. So that's the thing I like most, is just being out there and continuing that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="When Métis people put fire onto the landscape, it’s on a much smaller scale than most prescribed burns, often described as a fire you can walk beside. (Photo: Jordan Melograna, Indigenous Leadership Initiative)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/INDIGENOUS_walkbeside.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now, of course, many of us do consider fire frightening, dangerous. How do you protect yourselves from the potential dangers of being around large-scale fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: So I think for us, when we're talking about cultural fire, it's usually a fire we can walk beside, is another term that we use for it. So like, when we go out, it's almost like a campfire moving across the ground, like that's about the scale of it. So for me, like I don't feel scared or like it's dangerous, it's really kind of quite a nice calming practice that we do. Most cultural burners I know have never had an escape fire, but you always have that in the back of your head like, well what if, and so I would say that I burn with way more caution than I used to, because of this and because of my role in like the advocacy components of it. You know, for me, what that does is because we're removing that dead, dry vegetation from the landscape and promoting a healthier environment, that's really where then when we see these out of control fires, it's much easier to stop the fires. So, you know, as a fire is coming towards my area, because I have burned and we have, like, a lot less dead vegetation that the fire can basically eat as it's moving towards us, it makes it easier for firefighters then to put out the fire. So, yeah, it's proven to reduce wildfire risk to communities from out-of-control fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So your podcast is called “Good Fire.” What is good fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: So with good fire, you know what we're trying to do is produce like a mosaic landscape. You know you have old growth forest and you know older trees, but then you also have, like, meadows, and you have younger trees, and you have a mix of deciduous trees and coniferous trees, so like leafy trees and needle trees. And the reason we do that is so that we have less far to travel to access, like the cultural resources that we need. And when I'm talking about bad fires, what I'm talking about is these like climate change-induced fires that are burning at such high intensity and with such severe impacts that they're really devastating the forest for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Satellite imagery of smoke from wildfires spreading through Canada’s Northwest Territories, August 10, 2024. (Photo: Pierre Markuse, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/INDIGENOUS_satellite.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now your fire knowledge is not just from Métis cultural practice. You also have a history with Western-based science education and research. How have you combined those two, the Indigenous practice and the Western practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yeah, so I did my PhD, actually with the Métis community, learning about cultural fire and then I went and worked for the Canadian Forest Service and there I was a fire social scientist for almost 14 years. And so what I found was, when I started, I was very idealistic, and I thought, you know, if we just have, like, a really good Western scientific paper or something like that, it'll change people's minds and let us be able to start burning, and so I would say that we've produced paper after paper on that and have actually seen very little change. And what I then realized is really it's an issue of power and systemic racism that we're experiencing. It's not a lack of scientific knowledge or Indigenous knowledge. It's really much bigger things at play that are keeping us from being on the land. A lot of discussion about, you know, how we allow Indigenous people to burn, but really, like, burning is an inherent right, it's not something that people allow us to do or not. So I got offered a position at Indigenous Leadership Initiative, which is really an advocacy-based conservation organization that's Indigenous-led. And so here we're really trying for action now, so to really target policies, regulations and other things that are keeping us from being able to burn. And so we're not obsessed with fire. We're obsessed with like, healthy landscapes, and fire is one way that we can get to that. And you know, when I'm even speaking about cultural fire now, like, I show videos behind me of cultural fire, because usually once you show it, then people are like, I had one lady come up to me and be like, oh, that's all you want to do. And it's like, yeah. Like, it's not like, you know, we want to go and start like, you know, mountainsides on fire, although maybe there's some elders that eventually would want to do that. But you know, for us, it's just having a lot of fires on the landscape that are small and are controlled that produce these mosaics that we want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And in what ways have you seen successful collaboration between various different Indigenous groups and also perhaps non-Indigenous groups when it comes to fire management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Amy Cardinal Christianson is Cree Métis, and grew up in Treaty 8 territory in Northern Alberta. She is a Senior Fire Advisor for Indigenous Leadership Initiative and co-hosts the Good Fire podcast, which looks at Indigenous fire use around the world. (Photo: Jordan Melograna, Indigenous Leadership Initiative)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/INDIGENOUS_acc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yes I think probably the best example is I've worked quite a bit with the Blood Tribe over the last five years. So they're down in southwestern Alberta. Alvin First Rider and his team there have been working really hard to establish a fire guardian program, and they've done that in partnership with Parks Canada. And I think what's been great there is that Parks Canada has been a really good supporter, but not trying to control, if that makes sense. And I think part of that is because, at the moment, the guardians aren't trying to burn directly in the national park, but they've been coming out and supporting burns on the reserve, and it was a really great experience working with them. And the Blood Tribe program has just been inspirational and I hope that we see it replicated across Canada. You know, because of the changes to the forest and climate change in many areas like we can't just go out and put cultural burning back on the landscape like we used to. Those areas need either a prescribed fire or mechanical thinning, or hand thinning to remove a bunch of that vegetation that's in those areas because if we went and tried to do a cultural burn there using the techniques we usually use with community, it would just be way too big of a fire for us to control. But to me, that also speaks to where really good partnerships can come in, you know, like if an agency that has access to heli torches, you know, where people don't actually have to be in the fire, they can just drop fire into an area and they have all the firefighting equipment and other things, if they can go into those areas and burn them first, then we can slowly begin to bring cultural fire back to that area in a safe and sustained way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And how can this Métis burning practice be a tool for healing or cultural connection among Métis people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRISTIANSON: Yeah. So I really think the beauty of it is just getting people out on the land together and really being proud of their culture. So any workshops that we've had where we've brought Métis people together, it's just been a wonderful experience, especially we've done a few with youth, where we go out and, you know, teach youth about why this practice was important. And most have really no idea that Métis people used to burn like this. It was an important part of the buffalo hunt and trapping. The other thing that I've really liked about it is just being able to work so closely with like our relatives, like the First Nations, because really, you know, we're related to those folks. We use fire in similar ways to them, and it's really been a wonderful, like, way of unity, if that makes sense. Like there's so many, you know, divisive things in the world, but when you really get people out on the land and learning and being with one another, it really helps, and for, you know, mental health, physical health and other things of people who participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;

They do essentially the same work as other firefighters but are paid as little as around $5 a day. Eddie Herrera Jr. shares with Host Aynsley O’Neill what it was like to serve as an incarcerated firefighter, and how the experience helped him forge a new life after prison as a professional firefighter.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Jenni Doering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And I’m Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wildfires that have burned entire neighborhoods in Los Angeles this January took a massive response from firefighters to start to get under control. According to state officials more than 16,000 personnel battled the blazes across southern California at the height of the disaster. And over 1,000 of those people are currently serving prison sentences. While incarcerated firefighters do the same work as their counterparts, they are paid much less, as little as $5.80 a day. Here to talk to us about his experience in the program is Eduardo Herrera Jr. Eddie served eighteen years in prison and spent the final two of them as a firefighter. Now, he’s a professional firefighter for the state of California. Hi Eddie, welcome to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Thank you for having me, pleasure to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So I understand that you were an incarcerated firefighter between 2019 and 2020, what is the day to day life like for an incarcerated firefighter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So for me, it’s very unique. I actually lived at a firehouse. So my title was Institutional Municipal Firefighter. So what you would see in your normal municipal firehouse was very much the day to day, other than me being incarcerated, obviously. So I got up in the morning, did my training, did my six minutes of safety and weather, and then started my day running calls or just doing training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now is that the standard setup, or was yours a unique case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-31/FIREFIGHTING_uniform.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So in the state of California, every adult prison has a firehouse to service the prison system itself, but that also some of them have what we call a mutual aid contract. And not all of them do. But in my case, mine had a strong mutual aid contract with the county I service, and so that therefore you service the community where you're housed at. But to be clear, that station is outside the prison grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now, we're talking about this in terms of wildfires. But was that the majority of calls that you were taking, or were there other types as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: For the most part, it's a lot of medical calls, but there's definitely a balance between vegetation fires, wildland fires, vehicle accidents, residential structure fires, rescues. So depending how the season goes or the call volume is, it can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And how did you become involved in this program in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So I started with requesting to be there. I had to work my way down and go through a vetting process, and obviously applying, and then going through an interview process with the captain of the firehouse, and then upon completion of the interview, then I was able to go through an actual testing process. It takes approximately two and a half months to three months, and you do the cycle motor skills, and then you also do the academic and curriculum part of it. So completing that, once you upon completing that, now you actually can shadow but if you do not complete that, then you actually go back to the prison you're housed at and you're not in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now there's been a lot of discussion surrounding fair compensation with incarcerated firefighters, especially in the light of these recent wildfire outbreaks in California. During your time, when you were incarcerated, how much were you paid for your firefighting work, and how did you feel about that compensation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Incarcerated firefighters are currently fighting the L.A. wildfires while getting paid well below minimum wage. (Photo: Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-31/FIREFIGHTING_fire.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So it's very different. I will say I got paid a lot less than your fire camp or wildland firefighters. I figured, since we were servicing the community and actually going into people's houses to perform medical and mitigate those situations and actually being close to the community, I thought it would be more, but it was actually $56 a month. That was the max I would make. It didn't matter if I was running a residential structure fire, saving a house, or CPR call. It did not matter. I was still going to make $56 a month. So it's very little compared to what you make in fire camp. When you're actually fighting a fire, you make $1 an hour. So if you're out on a fire and that fire lasts three weeks, you do the math, it can add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now there's special concerns about this low compensation given the round-the-clock firefighting that is happening, especially with California opening the program up to inmates under 26. How do you respond to concerns about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Well, I definitely think that we should be compensated a lot more than what we're getting paid. I mean, simply put as this, we're doing the job, and now the public is is starting to see it, because we do save property. We do save lives, right? And so how can you put a price on that? And at the end of the day, like, the big picture is you do it because you believe in yourself. You want to demonstrate, you know, that you're not defined by your crime. But, I mean, let's be realistic, the amount of pay that you're making is really nothing compared to what an actual individual that does do the exact same thing gets paid a lot more. Not only that, gets a pension, right, and gets great medical service. And we, as inmate firefighters or incarcerated firefighters, are more exposed to smoke inhalation, and we're in the front lines, and so therefore those health issues affect us directly. So being in prison shouldn't be a death sentence, you know. So I totally think that there should be some compensation in regards to that, because at the end of the day, when you are released from the program, there's a very likelihood that you have some health issues moving forward in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Inmate firefighters receive all of the standard firefighting training while incarcerated, but if they want to continue with the career after their release, they must go through nearly identical training all over again. (Photo: Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-31/FIREFIGHTING_truck.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So as I understand it, you were trained to be a firefighter while incarcerated, and then after release, you had to undergo the same training all over again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: That is correct. So me, as an institutional municipal firefighter, all the training that I did there, I did it all over again when I went to the Ventura Training Center. But as far as the job itself, it's still the same. And the same thing as wildland firefighters that are in fire camp, you get the exact same wildland training because you're already doing the job, the work. So it's no different, but just with the training that I had, I could have done the job when I came home. But the one thing I will say is that most important is, it's invaluable, is the experience. Because I had more experience than some of these firefighters that are out now, that are 18, 19-year-olds that are working as firefighters. I had 14 structure fires under my belt, vehicle fires, countless CPRs, medical calls, and wildland fires, and was already doing the job. I will share with you this one call that I ran, saving a residential structure fire, pulling up, seeing it on fire, extinguishing the fire, but finding out afterwards it was a correctional officer's house, and them coming to me and my partner's hands and shaking her hand and saying, "Thank you for saving our house." So these are the things that we're capable of doing. That, in itself, demonstrates that that we can do the job. Who better than individuals that were previously incarcerated, that want redemption, want to prove themselves? We are one of the hardest workers out there, and we've demonstrated it time and time again, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Now there's a noted connection between personal history of trauma and incarceration. And then on top of that, we recently covered how merely being exposed to wildfires is traumatizing in and of itself, not to mention actually fighting these fires. So that's trauma on top of trauma. How do you and your fellow former inmates or the current inmates cope with the mental health aspect of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="While incarcerated, Eddie responded to a full range of calls from CPR calls at the prison to saving the house of a correction officer. (Photo: Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-31/FIREFIGHTING_rangeofcalls.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Great question, and I think that that is one of the biggest challenge. For me, I'll speak on my personal experiences. I did a lot of work prior to going to the firehouse, before I even started running calls and fire calls, so I developed coping skills, resiliency. However, there is a lot of trauma when you see things and experience that, as far as running wildland fire calls or just calls in general. And so when you see these things, you're taking them in, and they're just there. And if you don't know how to process them, eventually they come out. And so an individual that is currently incarcerated, seeing all this devastation, seeing these fires, is on heightened alert, always, high stress level situation, and then comes home, is released in society, and then now sees it again. They're triggered. And so being able to have things in place, as for instance, mental health, you know, addressing mental health is very important. And we don't, unfortunately; in the fire service or as an incarcerated firefighter, there's a stigma that goes with that that mental health. So a lot of people don't ask for help. I do believe that as an incarcerated firefighter and individuals are still incarcerated, it’s so important to address these issues, because upon coming home, just something like the smell of smoke or hearing the sirens can trigger it, you know? And so I think it's very important for that to be addressed now and recognized now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: What do you want people to know about either incarceration, generally speaking, or specifically the experience of incarcerated firefighters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Yes. So it makes me think about, I'm paraphrasing here, but a quote by Dostoevsky where he says, "You can tell a lot about a country by how it treats its prisoners." And so for me, the way I look at it is, well, how it treats his heroes, because an incarcerated firefighter is now deemed as a hero. So I think that that's very important, because we're no longer defined by our mistake that we've made. We're going to come home. 90% of the population that are currently incarcerated are coming home. What kind of people do you want them to come home to? Do you want an inviting society, and if so, demonstrate it in actions: allow the opportunities to be able to have programs, classes, just stuff, so they can come home as better people. I would say, for the general public and individuals that are now experiencing this to think about that, because the key to it is this one word is, is hope. We all want hope and hope for change, right? And that's exactly what myself and individuals who have been incarcerated, that's what allows us to survive and move forward, is that hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Eddie is grateful for the redemption that the incarcerated firefighting program offered him. He wants everyone to know that inmates are more than the crimes they are incarcerated for. (Photo: Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-31/FIREFIGHTING_eddie.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: We've talked a bit about the concept of redemption and change as it relates to this program. What kind of support is needed from the wider world when these formerly incarcerated firefighters and these former inmates, generally speaking, are coming home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So one of the biggest way you can support us is changing laws. In life, our words are validated by our actions. So if people really want to create change, they have to be willing to show up. And showing up is in the polls, is when they see something that's injustice, see something that's not right, is put it into action and change those laws. Because you guys are our voices. We don't have a right to vote. So for the public, what I would like to see changes is demonstrated in action by showing up and changing those laws that don't allow us to get paid what we should be getting paid, allowing us to have the funding, to be able to have classes and training in place, that if you are an incarcerated firefighter, therefore you're able to get the actual accreditation while you're still incarcerated, since you're already doing the job, so therefore when you are released, it's a lot easier for you to transition into that job and become a career firefighter. So I'm grateful that we're having this discussion now, because it's personal to me. So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Oregon faced its most destructive wildfire disaster, when more than a million acres burned in the “Labor Day” fires. After the firefighters finally headed home, it was the scientists’ turn to head out into the woods. The sheer size and severity of those fires gave them a unique chance to learn what happens after a massive burn. Science Reporter Jes Burns of OPB has the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: Sometimes, to understand what’s happening in a stream, scientists have to go fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: I'm ready whenever – fire in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX AMBI Beep/AMBI Beep and Splash]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: Field crew leader David Leer is knee-deep in remote and rocky Cedar Creek east of Salem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: Fishy, fishy. Oh, I saw one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: The forest around the stream burned in the 2020 Beachie Creek Fire – one of the Labor Day Fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX AMBI Beep/AMBI Beep and Splash]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: The beeps come from his bulky hard-plastic backpack. He waves a metal probe in the water in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: If you can hear the beeping, you put your hand in the water, you're probably gonna get a little jolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: This is electrofishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: Electrofishing is temporarily stunning the fish in the water and then snatching them up as fast as you can in the net. You know, we look like a Ghostbuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: Allison Swartz is an Oregon State University stream ecologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: The fish are doing their best to hide from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: There’s a fish 3 o’clock, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: Nice. There it is right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: I think that was a rainbow trout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: All the fish, tadpoles, crayfish and giant salamanders they catch will be counted, weighed and measured before being released back into the stream. The data are helping the team understand how streams changed following the Labor Day Fires. US Forest Service biologist Brooke Penaluna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/RIVER_santiamriver.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PENALUNA: So this study is unique in that we have 30 streams, you know, across 3 big mega fires in Western Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: The streams they’re studying are diverse. The Labor Day Fires burned around them at different severities. And the forests they’re in have been managed in a variety of ways – there’s tree plantations, more natural mixed aged forests, areas where the burned trees were salvage logged after the fire, and some unburned streams for comparison, says Swartz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: The reality is that wildfires are increasing on the landscape in severity and size, and so in terms of understanding how we manage our forests and these ecosystems, we need to know what's happening because we're really just kind of at the start of what we're going to begin to see in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: Ok, get ready. This is going to get exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: Every summer since the fires, crews have tested water quality and how the animals in the streams have fared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: Fish in your net. Out of your net. Going down. That was brutal. It jumped right in your net, then jumped out. Then gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: Many of the species depend on clean, cold water to flourish. But much of what’s left around Cedar Creek are trees like charred matchsticks. Without the canopy, the sun beats down on the water much of the day. Yet Swartz has started seeing some surprising trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWARTZ: Despite stream temperatures getting really warm in these systems after the fire, the fish populations are remaining just as high or higher than the unburned sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: The researchers are still unpacking exactly why. One theory is that more sun means more algae, which feeds the food web. Also without trees and vegetation sucking up the water on stream banks, there’s more left for the rivers, says Penaluna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A coastal tailed froglet, pictured mid-transformation from tadpole into adult frog. Coastal tailed frogs are one of the species that live in stream ecosystems throughout the Oregon Cascades. (Photo: Evan Rodriguez, OPB)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/RIVER_froglet.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PENALUNA: With the extra rains that are coming straight down and into the stream - with that runoff - you're getting additional fringe habitats along the streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: And it’s not just fish. Preliminary results are showing that the wildfires haven’t caused declines in amphibians either. But the researchers have seen fewer frogs in places where heavy post-fire salvage logging happened. For the longest time, stream ecosystems were thought to suffer because of wildfire. But in the five years since the Labor Day Fires, these scientists are seeing signs that the trout and other species that call the Cascades home are thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PENALUNA: Essentially everything we thought we knew about fire, we've kind of turned it on its head here on the west side of Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BURNS: And the research shows that the tragedy of the Labor Day Fires has turned into an opportunity. A chance to figure out the best way to manage our forests after wildfire to protect our streams and all the life they contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEER: Yup, it’s right here. Right here. That’s a different fish.&lt;/p&gt;

Under a state law enacted in October 2025, incarcerated firefighters are now paid at least $7.25 per hour while actively fighting fires. Formerly incarcerated firefighter and current fire apparatus engineer for the state of California, Eddie Herrera, Jr., returns to Living on Earth to speak with Host Aynsley O’Neill about how this pay raise can help transform lives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And I’m Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wildfires like the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires rage across California, around 30% of the firefighters battling the blazes are incarcerated. This California penitentiary program trains inmates in the same skillset as professional firefighters and puts them on track to be hired upon release. Until recently, these incarcerated firefighters were paid an extremely low wage - typically between $5 and $10 a day. Now, that pay gap is starting to close. In October 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring incarcerated firefighters to be paid $7.25 per hour while actively fighting fires. Here to talk to us about the impact of this law is formerly incarcerated firefighter and current fire apparatus engineer for the state of California, Eddie Herrera, Jr. Hi Eddie, and welcome back to the show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you guys having me here again. It's awesome to be back and under a different title now, but it's awesome. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Congratulations on the promotion, yes. You've shared your story on the show before, but for those who might not remember, please tell us a little bit about your experience during your time as an incarcerated firefighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Yeah, so I served 18 years in the State of California, and then those last two years, I operated as a institutional municipal firefighter at an institution firehouse for the state of California. And so I fought wildland fires, vegetation fires, ran medical calls, structure fires, but yeah, that was my, my job. I was an incarcerated institutional firefighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: During that time, how much were you paid for your service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So I made $56 a month. That was the max I could get paid for that position, being at the firehouse, which came out to a roughly $1.80 an hour. And you get deductions for restitution and different stuff like that. It came out to like $41 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And for those who might not be aware, what is restitution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So restitution is what the courts apply to your case. In regards to restitution for whether it could be for victim, where it could be for court fees, it could be anything that has to do with the legal system. So if you have a lot of restitution, it can add up into the thousands, but fortunately for me, in my case, it was not that much. It was $200, so I paid that off. So yeah, it's just a court-imposed fee in regards to whether it's restitution for your victim's property or court fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/FIREFIGHTER_assembly.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So in terms of the pay, what would be the difference between an incarcerated firefighter and a non-incarcerated firefighter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: In comparison, it's a lot of a difference. So average, your Fire Fighter 1 for the state of California can make up to $62,000, and that would be your base pay. Definitely can increase if you are working overtime and you're out there fighting active fires. So if you do the numbers, I mean, let's just say $21 an hour, there's a big difference in regards to $1.80 an hour, or $1 an hour fighting active fires, as opposed to making that amount. So in comparison, it is a huge gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So as of October 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom has now signed a bill that requires incarcerated firefighters in the state of California to be paid $7.25 an hour while assigned to an active fire. On a practical level, how will this change the lives of incarcerated firefighters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Wow, great question. On a practical level, it is big, and let me explain to you how what I mean. Not only is it good as far as public safety and the reason why it goes back to restitution. This is part of being able to give back for whatever crime you committed, whatever offense, you're able to now the state and the victims are able to get back, right, restitution, because the more you make, the more it goes towards your victims. As well as, public safety wise is, the more money you make, the more you're able to transition when you do come home, because you're able to start having money to get set up, build a foundation. As opposed to before, it was very challenging, because you get out, you get your gate money, your $200 upon release, and then you're going to be rely heavily on the state services or family members, right? So in this case, it's very different in the sense that you can realistically be paroling with up to $20,000 in a good fire season, right? So if you manage your money wisely, have that money saved up, you can have money to get yourself food, clothing, whatever it is you need to do to transition back into society. So if you think about it in the sense of public safety, it's less of a burden on the state and society itself to be able to have to say, hey, we're just going to have a revolving door in recidivism, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Mm hm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERERRA: So it's huge, in that sense. So now with this pay, it's going to allow them to, one, pay restitution, two establish a foundation upon coming home, and three, actually start helping out family members and loved ones while they're in there. Because most individuals, when they're in there, it's a huge burden on family and loved ones, because they're the ones that are supporting their loved ones that are still incarcerated. So now, in this case, it kind of flips that, right? They no longer have to ask for help. Instead, they're the ones being able to say, "Hey, I want to take care of my daughter, take care of my son, take care of my mom." And they can actually start sending money home, if they like. So yes, it's huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Herrera says that one of the key benefits of raising the wage of incarcerated firefighters is that it enables them to support their families while incarcerated. Pictured here is Herrera with his mother Rosie Herrera. (Photo: Daisy Herrera, Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/FIREFIGHTER_withmother.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And what have you been hearing from currently incarcerated firefighters about this bill? You know, how have they been reacting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So it is huge. And the feedback is, it's life changing because now they're able to do the stuff that they've been wanting to do, which is pay restitution, so they don't have to worry about upon release, that hindering from being off of parole, which is very huge, because that's another obstacle you have to overcome when you're trying to get a job. So it opens up a lot more avenues as far as employment. So that's huge. And so majority of them, I would say, are very, very excited to see that first check and see what it looks like. But more importantly, I can't emphasize this enough, the word that is being used a lot is to be seen. You know, to be seen. It demonstrates that you are no longer defined by your mistake that you made. You can take accountability, responsibility for it, and demonstrate to society, to the public and your victims, that the way you make amends is by giving back and being of service, right? So it's not throwing the key away and just say, "Hey, we're done with you." Well, no, 90% of the population that's incarcerated right now will be coming home, so this is part of that rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Well, so, this is obviously a massive change in the amount of money that these incarcerated firefighters are going to be paid. What kind of system do you think needs to be in place in order to help these firefighters take full advantage of this wage increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="According to Herrera, the public’s response to the Palisades and Eaton fires was key to the passage of bill AB 247 because they saw incarcerated firefighters in action. Here is a photo Herrera provided of a firefighter handling the Eaton Fire. (Photo: Courtesy of Eddie Herrera Jr.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/FIREFIGHTER_eaton.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: So what we are currently working on right now is presenting and offering financial literacy and money management classes. So now at all fire camps, this will be a curriculum that can be presented to them. So then, therefore individuals that will be making this money can now actually make educated, informed decisions of what to do with this money that they will now be receiving. And I think that that that is important because I believe the public would want to know also what's going to happen with that money. And I feel like as a taxpayer, I would feel better knowing that individuals that are going to be making more money while they're incarcerated are not going to foolishly spend that money. I believe that we, all in this world, can use, you know, some financial literacy and money management, right? So why not an individual that's still going to be able to have an opportunity to save a lot of money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: From what I understand, the general public's response to the Palisades and Eaton fires earlier this year sort of helped push this bill along. Talk to me about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Yeah. So it definitely did because a lot of individuals that were affected by it were individuals of power, and they got to see firsthand incarcerated firefighters fighting fires alongside career firefighters. So to visually see that was very impactful for them because now they're able to put a face and put an image to what they did not know about before, which was incarcerated firefighters and what they do. And so, as you know, when you're in need of help, you don't question, you know, who's the one that's helping you. You just need help, right? So this was huge in the sense that it affected Los Angeles County. And Los Angeles County showed up. The people spoke and demonstrate that they were willing to pay, as far as wages go, for individuals that were actually there saving their homes and lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Eddie Herrera Jr. is a fire apparatus engineer for the state of California. Eddie, thank you so much for taking the time with me today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERRERA: Thank you for having me. I appreciate you and looking forward for greater things to happen for us.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Living on Earth listeners! This week we finally get to share with you something we’ve been working on for the last few months: our special about wildfire threats and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by climate disruption, decades of fire suppression, and development in fire-prone areas, wildfire disasters are now hitting US communities so frequently that it’s easy to become desensitized to them. So, we wanted to take a step back and look at some other aspects of wildfire beyond what you might hear during an acute disaster itself. We knew we didn’t want to shy away from some hard truths, but we also wanted to include plenty of hope. Here’s the rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked with a Stanford University professor about his research into wildfire smoke and mortality and learned that wildfire smoke currently kills around 40,000 people in the U.S. every year, on par with U.S. car crash fatalities each year. (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We welcomed back a formerly incarcerated firefighter to discuss the big pay raise California incarcerated firefighters just received. (They were previously paid just $5-10 &lt;em&gt;a day&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed the mental health impacts of wildfire and some ways to cope, as yours truly shared what it was like when the 2003 Cedar Fire hit my hometown of San Diego.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We learned about how some Oregon streams and fish are showing surprising resilience after extremely intense wildfires in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we spoke with a Cree-Métis Indigenous person who practices and advocates for “good fire" — or low-intensity, cultural burning — to not only reduce fuels, but also to rekindle traditions and cultivate healthier ecosystems.

If you like this show, we think you’ll also enjoy these previous LOE stories about people and nature recovering from extreme wildfire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00003&amp;amp;segmentID=2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwood Rebirth After Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Nearly all the tall coast redwoods in California’s Big Basin Redwoods State Park burned in a 2020 wildfire. But within a few months, the charred trunks had grown a fuzz of healthy green shoots. A paper documents how the trees were able to regenerate using energy reserves stored for many decades. &lt;/p&gt;

Wildfires like those that hit southern California in January 2025 take an enormous social and psychological toll on victims and observers alike. We hear how people and communities can heal from the ‘climate trauma’ brought by wildfires and other disasters linked to the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00009&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Brancaccio on Fire Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
The thousands of homes that burned in Los Angeles this January included the home of Marketplace Morning Report Host David Brancaccio. He shares what he’s learning about the challenges of rebuilding with a limited supply and huge demand for contractors. David says there’s an opportunity to rebuild a more wildfire-resistant Altadena, and to heal the community itself. 
And we checked back in with David Brancaccio this fall to hear about his hopes to rebuild with fire-resistant material: &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00043&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;Building Back Better After Wildfire&lt;/a&gt; 
  
&lt;strong&gt;We want to hear from you!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you have a story of recovery or rethinking your relationship with wildfire you’d like to share?&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;

Host Jenni Doering tells Host Aynsley O’Neill about her frightening childhood experience of the 2003 Cedar Fire in San Diego and they discuss emotional resilience strategies shared by Jyoti Mishra, a UCSD professor of psychiatry who co-directs the University of California Climate Change and Mental Health Council.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So of course, extreme wildfires take a huge physical and mental toll and Jenni, I think this is where things get a little personal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: That’s right Aynsley. As you know, I grew up in San Diego. And in October 2003, back when I was still in middle school, the Cedar Fire exploded to hundreds of thousands of acres right in and around the city. It was so dry that fall that my wonderfully eccentric English teacher led us in a “rain dance” which, now that I think about it, was likely a bit culturally offensive… but anyway, within days that fire sparked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Oh Jenni, I hate to be a bit glib, but that must have been a pretty bad rain dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: I mean I guess so. You know, it’s dark, but you have to find ways to laugh about it afterwards. I mean, neighborhood after neighborhood was literally being ordered to evacuate as the fires advanced and left behind only chimneys. The sky was so dark in San Diego, the sun was red, there were ashes falling like some kind of weird SoCal snow. And my family never did have to evacuate, but the fire got really close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/PEOPLE_cabinwoods.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Oh, that’s so scary. I mean it sounds downright apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It really was. And it’s weird, thinking back on it, as a kid that felt like such an extreme and one-time trauma, like something that would never happen again. But now I know that these disasters are becoming much more common thanks to climate disruption, and so that’s a whole other layer of heartbreak that I’m still coming to terms with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I can only imagine, and I mean given how common wildfire smoke is these days, I’m wondering if that might be a bit triggering for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, I mean I think so, and you know, you can’t help but be reminded of those very frightening Cedar Fire days even from just a whiff of wildfire smoke. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m OK, but it’s really a relief to find researchers who are studying not just the mental health impact of wildfires but also strategies to help people cope, researchers like Jyoti Mishra who we had on the broadcast back during the Los Angeles Fires in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The ghostly limbs of a large Manzanita bush that succumbed to the Cedar Fire in William Heise County Park, but re-sprouted lush new growth in the years afterwards. (Photo: Jenni Doering)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-28/PEOPLE_bush.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Yes, Jyoti is a co-director of the University of California Climate Change and Mental Health Council and associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. And she’s studied mental health impacts in the aftermath of the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California and the 2023 Maui blazes in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISHRA: We see that not surprisingly, individuals' mental health is greatly impacted and people show varying degrees of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. And the brain kind of goes into a hyperalert stress state and so it's difficult to focus on tasks on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: You know, it’s been a long time since I lived through a major wildfire but I really do remember that hyperalert feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The 2018 Camp Fire was California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire to date, burning over 153,000 acres and destroying nearly 19,000 structures, including the town of Paradise. (Photo: Pierre Marcuse, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-01-10/FIRES_campfire.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And you know in terms of resilience strategies, when Jyoti studied people who had survived the Camp Fire in California, one-third showed those distress symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression or being hyperalert. But the other 70% who had shown more resiliency had a couple key things in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISHRA: Taking care of your physical self is very important, having good sleep hygiene, being able to sleep well, being able to exercise is very important. And then we've also found that people who were more mindful, that is people who practice more present moment awareness, those people did better. And then finally, a really important factor is social connection, being connected to those in your family and in your community and having a great support network around you, can really protect you from such a catastrophic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I mean it rings true, and we hear over and over again with disasters, it’s the importance of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: We need each other for sure. You know, Aynsley there’s one more thing to share. The cabin my grandparents built in the mountains east of San Diego, our beloved weekend home tucked in a pine and oak forest, was in the direct path of the fire. And we thought for sure it was a goner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dr. Jyoti Mishra, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California San Diego.

&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Oh but it survived? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Well, firefighters were able to spray it with fire-retardant foam just in time before the flames swept right through. And Aynsley, knowing what I now know about PFAS in firefighting foam… well… that’s a complicated mix of emotions to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I bet, it comes with all those health concerns. So, instead of what, out of the frying pan and into the fire… now you’ve got a… what, out of the fire and into the nonstick frying pan of forever chemicals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, I guess that’s one way to put it! Well, whatever was in it, that foam must have really worked because the fire burned so hot at the cabin that there were still live coals smoldering between oak tree trunks a whole week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Oh my gosh, wow. That is intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, and honestly, the trees looked dead. But before long, most of those oaks sprouted new green leaves as the forest started to recover from that trauma. And eventually, so did we.&lt;/p&gt;

The leaders of that team were Doug Dockery, who became chair of Environmental Health at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Arden Pope, now a distinguished professor of agricultural economics at Brigham Young University. They are co-authors of the 2025 book, Particles of Truth: A Story of Discovery, Controversy, and the Fight for Healthy Air, and they share with Host Steve Curwood the story of how they undertook their vital research and the industry pushback they received.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take a breath, an invisible poison may be entering your lungs alongside the oxygen you need. Tiny particles from burning everything from fossil fuels to forests can get deep into your lungs and even your bloodstream, exposing you to toxics like heavy metals and sulfates. We now know about the dangers of these particles, also called PM 2.5, but we were mostly in the dark about the scale of the problem and just how deadly air pollution could be until the 1970s. That’s when a team of researchers began the Six Cities study, which ultimately brought air pollution to the forefront of public health. The leaders of that team were Doug Dockery, who became chair of Environmental Health at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Arden Pope, now a distinguished professor of agricultural economics at Brigham Young University. These two pioneering researchers who documented the health effects of air pollution are co-authors of the 2025 book, Particles of Truth: A Story of Discovery, Controversy, and the Fight for Healthy Air. Welcome to Living on Earth, Arden and Doug!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Thank you. We're glad to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: Great to see you, Steve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now breakthrough research often begins with some serendipity. So Arden Pope, please tell us what you observed and researched that kind of started much of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Well, for me, it started back in the 1980s, late 1980s when a steel mill in our local valley shut down for 13 months and reopened. And this actually produced a very interesting natural experiment where we could look at the changes in air pollution when the mill shut down, and we could also look at changes in pediatric respiratory hospital admissions. And although I was not really doing air pollution research at the time, this was such an interesting and unique natural experiment that I took advantage of it. The results were really quite dramatic. The air pollution from the local steel mill did appear to contribute not only a lot of pollution, but contributed to respiratory illness in children, and so I published that work, it caused kind of a local stir, as well as a generated interest by other researchers that were doing air pollution research, including Doug, and that just sort of led to ongoing efforts to further understand air pollution and its impact on health, and it's, it ended up being a career I never really planned, but it's been a good career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_popedockery95.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: What were the health effects that seemed to have affected children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: The initial health effects that we observed were, were fairly straightforward. It was hospital admissions for respiratory disease in children, but follow up studies, some of them that I did with Doug and his colleagues at Harvard, found that the air pollution contributed to respiratory symptoms, reduced lung function, and then ultimately, as we started studying this more, we could see changes in mortality counts across time, both for respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. So it was really quite striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And Doug Dockery, how did you get together with Arden Pope and begin what led you to study the health effects of air pollution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: We had been conducting a study in six cities across the United States for more than a decade when Arden's paper came out, and examining the effects of air pollution on respiratory health of children and adults. And when Arden's paper appeared, I got a call from a reporter who asked me to comment on it, and I had went back and read the paper, and I was just astounded at what an elegant study design it was. We had always wanted to do the type of experimental study where, what happens if you turn off air pollution? Can you see the benefits of that? And in fact, here he had this natural experiment and showing that when you did dramatically decrease the air pollution levels, you could see respiratory benefits of that. So we got in touch with each other. After that, Arden came to me and said, you know, I'm just an economist, I really don't know what's going on here. I have no experience in doing this. I'm getting beaten up by the local press about this, and I really need some help. And so we sat down, and I invited him to come to Harvard to make a presentation about his results, and we sat down and designed some follow up studies to strengthen the evidence from the work that he was doing, and that led to him coming to Boston on a sabbatical, and led to a long term collaboration we've had over the past 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Estimated adjusted mortality rate ratios plotted over mean concentrations of PM2.5 from the original Harvard Six Cities study. The Harvard Six Cities Study published in 1993 in the New England Journal of Medicine revolutionized the field of environmental health, linking chronic exposure to fine particulate air pollution to increased mortality and shorter life expectancy. (Photo: Figure 4.1 in Particles of Truth. Adapted and replotted from results reported in Dockery et al. An Association between Air Pollution and Mortality in Six U.S. Cities, NEJM 329, no. 24 (1993): 1753-1759.)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_graph.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Harvard environmental health professor Douglas Dockery recalls that after meeting Brigham Young statistician and professor C. Arden Pope and learning of his work they set on a path of discovery which would lead to one of the biggest breakthroughs in modern environmental health. And it started back in 1973 with the Arab oil embargo raising prices and cutting supplies. The US government decided America should reduce the risk of imported oil by looking more to the abundant source of domestic energy, coal. And with the burning of coal comes a lot of air pollution. So, the Harvard team, including John Spengler, a co-chair of the World Media Foundation, which produces Living in Earth, wrote and won a federal grant in 1974 to research the impact of dirty air on respiratory health. They chose six US cities to study: Portage Wisconsin and Topeka, Kansas with relatively clean air, Watertown Massachusetts and St Louis Missouri with moderate pollution, and Harriman/Kingston Tennessee and Steubenville Ohio, which were downwind of nearby coal-fired plants. All six of these cities were in white and mostly middle-income census tracts, avoiding possible confounding variables of diverse ethnicity and economic status. In 1989 Dockery and Pope first learned of each other’s work when they were interviewed by Science News reporter Janet Raloff. They then combined forces and Pope came for a sabbatical term at Harvard. That began years of deep analysis that revealed they had a large data set showing that health effects from air pollution went well beyond its respiratory risks. Again, followed by Brigham Young professor Arden Pope, here’s Harvard professor Douglas Dockery describing the evolution of the Six Cities study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: And we were following adults and kids in these communities with yearly examinations of their lung function and respiratory symptoms with the expectation that we would be seeing changes in their respiratory health. And ultimately, we did see those changes, but in the early 1990s, there was also evidence that when air pollution went up, we could see increases in daily mortality. And this raised the question, well, could we also see those effects on long term changes in life expectancy. In the communities with higher air pollution, we did in fact see shorter life expectancy by several years, in a fashion that really was very linear and very associated with these fine particle levels, what we now call PM2.5. And these are very substantial effects, much bigger than we expected, all in communities that at that time, were meeting the current air pollution standards to protect the public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lucky Strike cigarettes advertisement in Life magazine, 1936. The Harvard Six Cities study showed that on a population-wide basis air pollution in more polluted cities was contributing as much to attributable mortality as the fraction of people who smoked cigarettes. (Photo: Anton Rath, Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_smokingsanta.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: What kind of numbers were you talking about? What did you find in that first go around that surprised you? Arden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: I mean what we found is that in the most polluted city, there was about a 25 to 30% increase in mortality risk. Now that was stunning, because cigarette smokers at the time we knew that there was about 100% increase in mortality risk, but only about 25% smoked. But what we found is that there was about a 25% increase in mortality risk from just breathing. And of course, everybody breathes, and so the results implied that air pollution in the more polluted cities were contributing as much to attributable mortality as even cigarette smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Doug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: We found that life expectancy was about two years shorter in the communities with higher air pollution. And put that in context, if you cured all cancers in the United States, the net effect on life expectancy in the population would be about two years. So we were talking about a identifiable risk factor here, air pollution, that was as big as all the effects of cancer, and that was very sobering to us at that time, especially considering that these were all communities that were meeting the air quality standards for public health at that time. I mean, we were stunned by this and knew we had to replicate these results. As Frank Speiser said at that time, this is not going to pass the laugh test if we put this out in a journal without validating this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And Arden Pope, your work shows a lot about the global burden of disease. Just how big a deal is this around the world, getting exposed to PM2.5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Naples, Italy, in January 2025. The Global Burden of Disease Research Group estimates that fine particle air pollution contributes more to burden of disease than any other environmental risk factor and is in the top 10 of all risk factors contributing to disease and death globally. (Photo: keppet, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_naples.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: So it's a big deal. In the United States we see these effects that Doug and I have been talking about, but the pollution in the United States is actually relatively low compared to exposures in many other parts of the world, China, India and other places. If you take the studies that we and others have done looking at the long term exposures to air pollution, and you use the results from those studies and apply it to exposures that people are exposed to around the world, you can estimate the global burden of disease, and this has been done by the Global Burden of Disease Research Group, and they estimate that fine particle air pollution contributes more to burden of disease than any other environmental risk factor, and is in the top 10, sometimes even in the top 5 of all risk factors contributing to disease and death. So it's a remarkably large impact. And I think Doug and I started working together nearly 40 years ago, and I don't think either one of us even imagined that air pollution was that large of a contributor to disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah, you have a chart in your book that says that this is more hazardous to global health than terrorism, car crashes, all kinds of things that we think of, infectious disease, kind of mind boggling, it feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Yeah, I agree. I mean, it's been a big surprise to me that it has that large of an effect, and part of that's because these fine particles do have a lot of toxic materials, and they do contribute to both cardiovascular and respiratory as well as lung cancer. But the other thing is, is the exposure is so ubiquitous, pretty much everybody is exposed to this pollution, and in some parts of the world, the exposure is really remarkably high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="When the Harvard Six Cities Study was published in 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency was proposing a new standard for PM2.5, which would have required industry to reduce their emissions. (Photo: Texas GOP Vote, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_epa.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Doug, the Harvard Six Cities study caused quite a backlash from various actors, particularly industry. In fact, I think you were accosted by protesters one time, and you went to Capitol Hill to testify about this. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: I had been invited to testify at a Senate hearing on air pollution, and in fact, had actually taken the train down from Boston and got off at Union Station. And then you walk up the hill to Capitol Hill to the Senate office building. And as I was coming up the hill, I encountered a group of people in white coats and funny glasses and holding signs with, "show us the data." And I was intrigued, and went up to see what they were about, and found they were actually demanding the data from the Harvard Six Cities study. And it was really the first episode I'd encountered where we were being challenged like this. And it turned out that this was a demonstration that had been organized by the Center for Sound Economy, which was funded by the Koch brothers, to protest our work. And it follows the example of demands that have been developing to undermine epidemiology studies by demanding release of potentially personal data from the participants in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: They charge that you were conducting "secret science." What the heck is that? And why is such an allegation designed to make human health research impossible from your perspective, Doug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Charles Koch in 2019. Charles G. Koch and his brother David H. Koch funded organizations like the Center for Sound Economy, which sought to discredit the Harvard Six Cities study. (Photo: Gavin Peters, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_koch.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: Well, of course, when we approached people to be participants in our study, we said we would keep their information confidential. So various groups came forward and said, well, we can only believe these data if we get to analyze them ourselves. And so we certainly made a practice of making data available to other investigators to analyze or reanalyze the data, but not to the extent that it would be identifiable as individuals and potentially compromise the assurances of confidentiality that we had agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Arden, what's going on here? What do you think this charge of "secret science," and I gather you guys were hit with a bunch of subpoenas and from the Congress and such, what do you think they were trying to do here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Well, it was very clear that there were these special interests that did not want to see these studies used to result in stronger regulations for air pollution, stronger standards for PM2.5. In fact, shortly after the Harvard Six Cities study and related studies were published in the mid 1990s, the EPA was proposing a new standard for PM2.5 that would require industry and other polluting sources to reduce their emissions. And so it's way easier to make a lot of money if you don't have to pay part of your costs. And part of the costs of burning fossil fuels are these health costs that we were observing, and so one way to try to avoid those costs is to simply deny them. And that seemed to be what was going on, and I think is still going on to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And by the way, I think some of the folks who brought actions, even some litigation, states like West Virginia, for example, are still doing that when it comes to climate disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Yeah, the sort of strategies to deny this research were developed actually to discredit some of the studies with regards to cigarette smoking. These strategies have been used to deny the effects of air pollution and also deny the effects of the greenhouse gasses and the impact on, on our climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So obviously, Six Cities study is a big deal and comes under attack. How was it backed up by subsequent research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The 2025 Palisades fire in Los Angeles. Our guest Dr. Doug Dockery warns that pollution from wildfires will continue to threaten public health. (Photo: Frank Kovalchek, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/PARTICLES_palisades.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: When we got the results, at least the initial results from the Harvard Six Cities study, we were as surprised as anybody. We did not expect to see such large impacts of air pollution on respiratory and cardiovascular disease mortality. And so we actually contacted the American Cancer Society, collaborated with them to use another big, large cohort that they had been following so that we could see if we could replicate the results of the Harvard Six Cities study. And in fact, in general, we were able to replicate those results. And so we published the results of both of those studies back in the mid 1990s and then even both of those were criticized. And then we actually cooperated with the Health Effects Institute and a research team that did a big reanalysis of both of those studies to see if they could replicate the results, see how robust they were. And in fact, they replicated the results and found that they were remarkably robust. And then since that time, there have been many other cohorts that have been analyzed, the US, in Canada, in Europe, in China, and in general, they are finding basically similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Doug, where are we in terms of improving air quality, both here in the United States and around the world? I think around the world, deaths from particulates are on the scale of like 7 million a year excess deaths. What extent have we made significant strides, and what can we do to bring those numbers down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: Well, I think there is a positive story here in that when you compare air pollution now to where we were 40 years ago when we started this research, we've seen very, very substantial improvements in air quality across the United States, but we're still seeing effects, for example, of uncontrolled wildfires impacting large parts of the United States. Internationally, there's been recognition of where the high air pollution levels are, particularly with the use of satellite data, which provides information on areas where there was no monitoring before. And so we recognize now, in Africa, in Southeast Asia, in China, the very, very high concentrations that existed before there. But also this has brought pressure on the local governments to actually take some action. So we are seeing progress around the world as it's been recognized, that these are preventable health effects, and there is a real opportunity to have substantial benefits from this. I mean, one of the key findings has been that when we see air pollution improved, we also see reductions in the health effects, and we've demonstrably improved health in communities where air pollution has improved. It was demonstrated with the Southern California studies that when children moved out of the high air pollution levels, you could see improvements in their lung function. So improving air quality leads to better health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Arden?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POPE: I think we should think of this as basically not just scientific discovery, but also to some degree, good news. Anytime you can find a controllable risk factor for disease and death, that is great news, because then what you can do is you can control that risk factor, and we could substantially improve the health and welfare of people throughout the world by finding ways to reduce our air pollution. And I actually don't think that that's an unreasonable expectation. So I think we should look at this as not just sort of, ah, the sky is falling, kind of research, but it's research that can be used to improve the health and welfare of populations everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Arden Pope is a distinguished professor of economics at Brigham Young University. Doug Dockery is an emeritus professor of environmental epidemiology at the T.H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health. Thank you both for taking the time with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE: Thank you, Steve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOCKERY: Thank you, Steve.&lt;/p&gt;

Through a tumultuous year for public radio, Living on Earth has continued to grow and thrive, &lt;a href="https://loe.org/about/donate.html"&gt;thanks as always in great part to you, our listeners and readers&lt;/a&gt;. Here are just a few of our accomplishments we wanted to share. 
  
&lt;strong&gt;LoE Interns&lt;/strong&gt; 
Living on Earth’s internship program is closing in on 400 participants across our 34 years of broadcast. LoE interns have gone on to careers as journalists and professors, among many other professions. One LoE intern alum went on to serve as the mayor of Princeton, New Jersey. LoE interns bring incredible energy, enthusiasm, and new ideas to the Living on Earth editorial process.  
  
By the way, if you or someone you know might be interested in a Living on Earth internship, this is “last call” to apply for Spring 2026 by Wednesday, November 26th! Learn more &lt;a href="https://loe.org/about/jobs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  
  
&lt;strong&gt;Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media&lt;/strong&gt; 
The &lt;a href="https://cejm.media/"&gt;Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media&lt;/a&gt;, based at the University of Massachusetts Boston &lt;a href="https://www.umb.edu/environment/"&gt;School for the Environment&lt;/a&gt;, tells compelling stories of environmental and climate justice through radio broadcasts, podcasts, and multi-media communications, while also providing media instruction for UMass Boston students and faculty. The Center draws voices from a broad diversity of experiences, striving to fairly and accurately inform local, regional, and global communities about today’s and tomorrow’s critical environmental and climate justice concerns. 
  
CEJM hosted its first ever conference at UMass Boston on September 17-18, with more than 200 attendees. The conference featured Dr. Robert Bullard, father of environmental justice and Distinguished Professor at Texas Southern University, Dr. David Cash, the newly appointed Director of Harvard’s Climate Action Accelerator, and Goldman Environmental Prize winner Nalleli Cobo. The event brought together environmental justice leaders and community activists from all around the country.  
  
&lt;strong&gt;LoE Stories&lt;/strong&gt; 
A key part of every week at Living on Earth is our conversation about the past week’s program. The entire LoE team listens to every episode and shares thoughts about what we loved and potential refinements to future episodes. Heading into the holiday season seems like a great time to share a few of the stories that were favorites for the LoE team this past year. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00035&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oyster Trash to Treasure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Oysters on the half shell are big business on Nantucket Island, and a local program recycles oyster shells from restaurant waste into habitat for young oysters. Host Aynsley O’Neill reports on how these recycled oyster shell reefs are helping to protect the coastline from worsening storms and rising seas. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00020&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pope Leo and Creation Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
The new Pope, Leo XIV, has worked with interfaith environmental networks and there’s hope around the world that he may follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Pope Francis and bring issues of the environment and climate change to the forefront of his agenda. Dr. Erin Lothes is a former professor of Catholic theology who now promotes global eco spirituality education and climate action with the Laudato Si’ Movement and she joins Host Aynsley O’Neill to shed light on Pope Leo XIV’s rhetoric on environment. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00013&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deb Haaland on Our Public Lands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Deb Haaland became the first Native American cabinet member when President Biden appointed her as Secretary of the Interior and helped consult with tribes to designate new national monuments. Now she’s running for Governor of New Mexico, and Deb Haaland joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss the current threats to public lands and her deep ancestral connections to the New Mexican landscape 
  
&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt; 
None of our work can happen without you. The support we receive from listeners fuels our work. Whether it’s sharing the Living on Earth podcast or newsletter with a friend, sharing a comment about a favorite story, or &lt;a href="https://loe.org/about/donate.html"&gt;making a gift to LoE&lt;/a&gt;, we deeply appreciate the role you play in helping LoE thrive! 
  
As you consider which organizations to include as part of your holiday season 2025 giving, we hope Living on Earth will be on your short list. 
  
Thank you!  &lt;strong&gt;Mark Kausch&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MUSIC: Roy Hargrove, Christian McBride, “Frosty The Snowman” on Jazz For Joy: A Verve Christmas Album, The Verve Music Group]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the holiday season. So, families and friends are gathering around the feast to share staples as well as some less common traditions. And a couple years back we gathered some of the Living on Earth folks together to get a taste of those recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And because this is an encore, longtime listeners will hear a familiar voice you haven’t heard in a while. Our Beyond the Headlines contributor Peter Dykstra passed away in 2024, and we still miss him. But we’re grateful for the moments we shared with him over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So, sit back, relax and enjoy this mouthwatering starter course from producer Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Yeah, I wanted to share my mother's pumpkin soup recipe, by way of Martha Stewart. You just cut up you know, two to three cups of pumpkin, simmer it with onion, garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, in either chicken or veggie broth. When that's all nice and tender, you puree the mixture, you got to be careful there because it's really hot, so be gentle with it. You return the pureed soup to the pot, and then you add some heavy whipping cream. Warm it first, so it doesn't curdle, and you serve it. And the Martha Stewart version suggests using a little mini pumpkin to serve it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_pumpkinsoup.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PANDELIDIS: Aww!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: But we use mugs so that the family can walk around and mix and mingle before we sit down to the main course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: How cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And if anyone's listening to us wondering that they didn't scribble down this recipe fast enough. It can all be found on the Living on Earth website, loe.org. So hey, what's next, Jenni?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Well, I think we've got Naomi Arenberg here and she picks the music every week. So Naomi, you've got some cranberries for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: I've got the reminiscence. I'm from a cranberry growing family. Both my father and grandfather were cranberry growers. And so that's the special part of Thanksgiving for me. You can use them, I think, in almost anything. I've got pie in front of me. And of course there's the sauce. I make it pure with just cranberries. You don't need to add water in the pot, but you can. A splash of home squeezed orange juice, a little bit of sugar. Always cut back on the sugar than any recipe has. Because you can always add it, but you can't take it out. And so just simmer that away until the cranberries are all popping in the pan. And be sure to let it cool thoroughly and sit for a day or more. And people will rave about your cranberry sauce. And I think that adds a bright, nice color to the table, whether it's Thanksgiving or any other holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Music Coordinator Naomi Arenberg suggests adding fresh squeezed orange juice to make the perfect cranberry sauce. (Photo: Emily Carlin, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_cranberrysauce.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah. Oh, man that, that cranberry sauce when it's bubbling away and making those popping sounds. It smells incredible too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah, that's great. And I do a version of that: cranberries, just a little bit of water in the cranberries, and maple syrup where I am in New Hampshire, instead of conventional sugar and it tastes delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And you tap those trees yourself. Right, Steve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Well, we have historically. My mom has. I haven't recently been tapping them, but our neighbors do and it is delicious. Also, just when it comes to the stuffing, I also put cranberries in the stuffing that I make. I have to confess that not everybody likes that in my family. So I make two versions of stuffing: with the cranberries and then those without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So speaking of stuffing, I think our Technical Director Jacob Rego who is usually not heard, but he does all the work behind the scenes on this broadcast and podcast. I think he wanted to tell us about stuffing as well. What you got Jake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REGO: Yeah, a recipe my family enjoys every year is Portuguese stuffing. It's a secret family recipe. But its key ingredient is a Portuguese sausage called chouriço. We never seem to have any leftovers, though, because it's a family favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Ooh, tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Mm, mm! That's so good. I've had food from where your family's from around New Bedford, Massachusetts. They put chouriço in almost everything and it makes it delicious. All right, let's turn now to our Director of Advancement and Program Strategy, Mark Kausch, who's famous for playing the double bass in symphony orchestras, but you have something else that's double for us today, Mark, I think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Twice-baked potatoes can hold any toppings you like. Mark Kausch, the Living on Earth Director of Advancement and Program Strategy, enjoys his with scallions and bacon. (Photo: Jo Ziimny Photos, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_potatoes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KAUSCH: Yes, double in a manner of speaking. Correct. At the front end of the pandemic, I reached out to my dad to say, hey, we're going to be trapped here in Minnesota, just the two of us, my wife and I. Can we have your twice baked potato recipe? He said sure. And it actually was one that he'd made up himself. It wasn't something that he found in a recipe book. And the more we got talking about it, the more it dawned on me that basically twice baked potatoes are kind of like making pizza or making nachos. You can kind of do whatever you want. Bake the potatoes, carve out the potatoes. Keep the potato skins as your bowls for later on. And then his recipe mashes in a bunch of butter, some scallions, bacon bits, with apologies to the vegans and vegetarians out there. But those are optional. And then you put it all back into the potato skins, and bake it for another 15-20 minutes. And I thought, well, this doesn't sound so hard, I can totally do this. And I was absolutely stunned at how complicated it turned out to be. And sadly, how I just couldn't quite do quite as well as dad did with his every-year recipe. I'm off the hook now because he's back at it. And I'm looking forward to his version and hoping that someday I'll do as well as he does. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: You'll have to shadow him in the kitchen this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KAUSCH: There we go. Good thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PANDELIDIS: Dad knows best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah, sounds like twice baked potatoes will be enough for a whole meal. Really, that could be the main entree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KAUSCH: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right, Steve. And it's, it's always fascinating to me how more often than not, it's the side dishes that are the most fun at Thanksgiving, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And some of the most filling. Well, I hope you still have some room in your stomachs because our Living on Earth contributor who looks beyond the headlines for us each week is here too. Peter Dykstra, what are you salivating over this Thanksgiving?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The late Living on Earth Contributor Peter Dykstra also used bacon to top his Thanksgiving mac and cheese. (Photo: Daremoshiranai, Flickr, CC BY-NC 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_macandcheese.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYKSTRA: Well, I'm not salivating. I'm still chewing on all of the prior recipes that we've heard. But I come from a long line of meat-eating, environmentally-hypocritical relatives. My contribution usually is just good old mac and cheese. But with bacon in it. It's simple elbow mac. I tried it one year with gluten-free elbow mac, not realizing that gluten-free elbow macaroni turns basically into mashed potatoes when you try and use it. Cheddar cheese, because you don't want the four-cheese stuff. Because cheddar cheese will out-taste just about anything. And we top it off with a lot of crumbled bacon. And it's usually the first thing to disappear at our table full of carnivores, with occasionally environmentally-bankrupt and hypocritical means at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Ha, okay. Hey, Jenni, what about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: All right, well, I hope you still have room because I love green bean casserole. And I have to say I used to hate the stuff that came from the can. You know, for me, it was these green beans that were cooked until death. So they were like gray, and then that can of mushroom soup from a can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jenni Doering makes her green bean casserole from scratch, following the Alton Brown recipe. (Photo: Jenni Doering)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_greenbean.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PANDELIDIS: Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: But now I'm completely obsessed with making it from scratch. And Alton Brown has an amazing recipe where in a big cast iron pan, you put all this stuff together and you first do blanched green beans. Then you sauté mushrooms into a luscious and delicious roux. And then you top that all with crispy, thin sliced onions and it is just delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: How does it sound to you Peter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DYKSTRA: It sounds like something I can't eat, with all due respect. I'm allergic to all manner of beans. Green beans, pinto beans, lima beans, string beans. So if we eat any of those things in a restaurant, I'll have to order myself an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Oh my goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Oh, dear. Well, Steve, we're hearing some to-die-for Thanksgiving recipes from the Living on Earth crew. But we haven't even gotten to the turkey yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: All right. You know, only the strictest vegans and vegetarians omit the turkey at Thanksgiving. It's that one time of year where maybe people make the exception. And a succulent delicious turkey with rice stuffing is amazing. And I learned from my mother-in-law that you can cook a turkey at a very low temperature, just a little over 200 degrees, overnight to keep it really juicy and not have the top of it dry out. And of course then you put in that stuffing with the cranberries and it's, it's amazing. As a youngster where we live in New Hampshire, the neighbor would grow turkeys. And so we would go by, select the live turkey that we wanted and then it would show up in our kitchen, all fully dressed. And that took me a little while as a kid to make the connection. And when I did I was kind of sad, but you know if you're gonna eat meat, you got to take responsibility for the process. Okay, well what do you say Jenni? You ready for dessert?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An easy and tasty way to recycle your pie crust scraps is to brush them with melted butter, cinnamon sugar, and roll them up before baking. (Photo: Jessica Langlois, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_piescraps.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: I'm ready. I mean, I might be bursting after dessert, but let's try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Kicking us off with dessert. I think we've got El Wilson. What have you got, El?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Yeah, in my family we use the leftover pie crust to make cinnamon scraps. All you do is roll the crust into a sheet, cover it with melted butter. And then sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar. You roll it up, cut it into pieces, and throw in the oven. They come out looking like mini cinnamon rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Mmm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Oh, yeah, that sounds really tasty. I'll have to try that. Now, Sophia Pandelidis, another one of our producers, I think you have a related dessert in your family repertoire, n'est-ce pas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sophia Pandelidis’ family takes their pie crust scraps and turns them into decorative pie toppers. (Photo: Courtesy of Sophia Pandelidis)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_pietopper.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PANDELIDIS: Yeah, that's funny, El. My family does almost the same thing. We roll out the leftover pie dough and sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar, too. But then instead of making it into cinnamon rolls, we actually cut it out in fun shapes, like cookies, we're talking leaves or pumpkins. And then we use those little shapes to decorate our pies. So it's fun and tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Cute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Yeah, that gets to play with the nice thing about this feast part of the holiday, getting together with folks, is being together, cooking and making things. It's not just a meal. It's a gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PANDELIDIS: Yeah. And it's an artistic process too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: All right, so we've got all this leftover pie crust. What are some of our favorite pies to make out of that pie crust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: Hmm. Don't get my mouth watering, please. I'll drip on the microphone. For me growing up as the daughter and granddaughter of cranberry growers, you can make a delicious, open-faced pie, please because it glistens. Even the next day. When you first take it out of the oven, invite everyone to circle around and look at this glistening creation. And then the next day, the color settles down. It stays really shiny. It's almost a stained-glass window there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An open-faced cranberry pie. (Photo: Jennifer Pallian, Unsplash, Unsplash License)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_cranberrypie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Ooh, beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: Yeah, too pretty to eat? Nah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Maybe a la mode, perhaps? Bit of vanilla ice cream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: Yes, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It's my favorite way to eat apple pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Any kind of pie! Well, thank you, Naomi. And by the way, speaking of pie, I should mention my grandmother's pumpkin pie, which was part of a very frugal Depression era way of thinking. If there are going to be pumpkins for decorating, they then need to be recycled into the pies that are going to happen at the holiday season. And grandma had a nice garden. Probably it was a victory garden for World War II at our house, and she grew her own pumpkins. But I guess not all pumpkins are made equal for this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sugar pumpkins are ideal for making pumpkin pie. (Photo: Diliara Garifullina, Unsplash, Unsplash License)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_pumpkinpie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: Correct. There is one variety that you often can find just in a normal, run-of-the-mill grocery store called sugar pumpkins that are grown to be used in a pie or in cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Probably explains why later in life when I tried to make pumpkin pie with ordinary pumpkins, they were kind of stringy and watery. Of course, you add enough sugar, you've got a pie. But now I know what grandma's secret was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So I think we're just about wrapped up here. But we have one more sweet thing to finish this out. Jacob, I think you've got something to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REGO: Yeah, dessert that is required for our family's Thanksgiving is a homemade chocolate fudge. You can find the recipe on the back of a jar of marshmallow fluff. It's a delicious mix of sugar, chocolate, fluff, butter, vanilla and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARENBERG: Mm, mm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Ooh. My family, we also always have a chocolate course. Now we don't make it from scratch. But some chocolates, some clementines, some eggnog is the perfect way to wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Our Technical Director Jacob Rego’s family loves making homemade fudge for Thanksgiving. (Photo: Rachel, Flickr, CC BY-NC 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2023-11-17/FOOD_fudge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Ooh, and maybe a taste of rum for some people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, it depends what kind of eggnog you're drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Well, Jenni, I guess that's it. So we better get on with the cooking, right? Because this is not a quick meal to whip together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Yeah, I think this might take a few days to create everything. All this sounds like a recipe for a food coma for me at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: There you go. And if you've been listening to us, and you're thinking, "well, what about..." just go to our website and you can see all these recipes there. And if you have any luck, write to us about what works well in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL: Happy Thanksgiving!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Happy Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOERING: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time 30 years, Brazil was the host of the UN Climate Treaty negotiations known this year as COP 30. And it’s no surprise that the country with most of the Amazon tropical rainforest led a major advance for forests and their indigenous inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: There have been other attempts to incentivize protecting forests, including carbon offsets, but these have been vulnerable to fraud and have had limited success. So, through the COP, Brazil, Norway and the Netherlands seeded a new $125 billion fund with guarantees for investors that will send its profits to countries with documented forest preservation, including some cash going directly to indigenous and local populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: For more on this critical ecosystem and the impact of the Tropical Forest Forever Fund or Facility, we called up Michael Coe who was at the COP in Belém Brazil. He is a Senior Scientist and tropical forest expert at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. Welcome to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: Thank you very much, Stephen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So Mike, can you please give us a sense of the state of the world's forests, and especially tropical forests, at this moment? Where are they, and just how much of them have we lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: You know, there's three big blocks of tropical forest. It's in South America, Southeast Asia and the Congo. And when we think about really, over the last only few decades, a tremendous amount those have been lost. The greatest amount of loss is in Southeast Asia, where something like 40% have been removed. South America, something like 17%, and the Congo, about 20%. So in each of these regions over the last few decades, there's been significant loss of forest, and most of that, of course, is for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Mike, tell us why tropical forests are so crucial. What's their role in the climate system and beyond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/COP30_xinguforest.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: They are really fascinating for the climate system. We think mostly about them in terms of their carbon. You know, they have an enormous amount of carbon in them, so when you deforest, you're emitting a great deal. But what I have been interested in, and what's really fascinating, is that that's not the only reason they're great for climate. Another big part is they are just giant air conditioners. What they do is pull water out of the soil from very deep down, and they evaporate it. And when they're photosynthesizing, they're evaporating water. And when you evaporate water, that's energy. You're taking heat, and you're converting water to vapor, and you're carting it away. So what they do is they cool the land surface enormously. And we see this throughout the tropics. If you deforest a parcel of land, it will almost immediately something like five degrees C warmer than the forest right next door, and that's on annual average. So if you walk out of the forest in the dry season, and you walk out onto an open field that is fallow, it is 10 degrees C hotter, 15 degrees C hotter. It is just astounding how much, and that's not just a local effect, but it has global implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It's almost like the forest is able to sweat like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: It's really exactly what it is. When it's photosynthesizing, it has to use that water to cool itself off. It's pulling in sunlight and it's getting hot. So that's exactly what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Well, just how much are deforestation and the degradation of forest adding to the climate emergency every year? I mean, compared to the burning of fossil fuels, what percentage of the problem are we looking at here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: It's big. When you say tropical forest, it might be, say, 10% of all emissions, human emissions. If you talk all forest on the planet, probably 20% of all emissions. So deforestation is a big number. For many nations, it's by far the largest. And China's number one in emissions. US is number two. Deforestation is number three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deforestation in eastern Mato Grosso, Brazil. Deforestation of tropical forests, typically for agricultural purposes, is responsible for about 10% of all global emissions. (Photo: Michael Coe)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/COP30_deforestation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And we talk about the carbon that it sequesters, but what about when you cut those trees down? How much carbon does it stop taking out of the air? What's the loss there and the effect on the climate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: You know, that's a big number. You're talking about something like 15% of human emissions are being pulled back out by forests, by tropical forests. So yeah, it's a double loss. You're shutting off this ability to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere, and then you're just putting more back in. So it's a big loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Wow. So at the end of the day, you have a 20% loss by cutting them down, and then you have another 20% loss of the forest pulling it out of the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: More or less, yes. I mean, that's what you're doing. You're shutting off your ability to pull it out, and you're emitting. So this is why, you know, some studies have shown that portions in the Amazon are now net emitters of CO2. Instead of net pulling it out, they're actually emitting more than they're pulling out, and that's because deforestation and the fires that are occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And by the way, I think we've been referring to deforestation, also to forest degradation. What does that actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: So forest degradation is when you still have the forest in place, but what you're doing is degrading how much carbon it has in it, basically how many trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: What leads to forests being so degraded, even if they're not completely cut down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: The number one source of degradation in the tropics is fire. And the thing about fire, I can say this for sure in the Amazon and in Congo, in these dense, wet forests, fire is not natural. It doesn't occur like it does in the boreal forests, where lightning strikes and a huge fire occurs. That does not occur in the tropics. These are fires lit by people. So they're burning pasture to rejuvenate the grasses. They're doing slash and burn so they can open land to plant rice or whatever. And so in many ways, it is a problem that can be addressed. We know it's being caused by humans. And this is one of the things we try to work on a lot in Brazil in particular, is how do we reduce fires? The land is chopped up into chunks, and those edges now are really susceptible fire, and fire goes in there and takes out a large fraction. Once you've done that, it's a cycle. Now there's more sunlight coming in, it gets hotter, it's more susceptible to fire. And so it's a pretty slippery slope once you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And by the way, to what extent are those fires related to the warming planet itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Burning fields near Yangambi, Democratic Republic of Congo. Fire is the number one cause of degradation in tropical forests. (Photo: CIFOR-ICRAF, Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/COP30_burning.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: A great deal. And so last year was an incredible example. It was an El Niño year, which meant it was hotter, much hotter and drier. So when fires did start, they got huge. And it looks like last year, degradation committed as much CO2 to the atmosphere as deforestation did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: So in most years, degradation's a significant number, but it's not as big as deforestation, you know. So it just essentially doubled the amount of CO2 emitted last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And by the way, just how important are tropical forests to the Earth's temperature? I mean, if we cut down all tropical forests, what do you think would happen to the global average temperature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: That's something we've been trying to quantify for a very long time, and recently, we did some experiments and put some work together, and we found that if you cut down all the tropical forests, every one, then the global temperature would probably rise by about one degree C, which is a large number. And what's really fascinating about that is half of that one degree C would be from all the emissions, the CO2 emissions, but the other half would be from that air conditioner that we broke. Those forests, as I mentioned before, they're an air conditioner, and they cool the planet. What's important here also to think about is okay, that means, if we deforest 10%, we raise the temperature by point one degrees C, which we really can't afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Every tenth of a degree matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: Every one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Michael, I know it's really hard to account for all of this, but it sounds like the problem with forests, tropical forests, them getting cut down and also being degraded, we're looking at a huge portion of the climate emergency. Looks like it's north of 30% or more that could be happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: It's a big number. These forests are extremely important for our stable climate, and it’s one of the things we keep saying is they are going to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change occurring because of fossil fuels, and we are eliminating that, that incredible gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (left) and UN Secretary-General António Guterres (right) attend the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. The TFFF is an investment fund designed to pay countries as well as local and indigenous persons for verified maintenance of their tropical forests.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So we're speaking to you at COP30 during its last days, and there's been a proposal led by Brazil for this Tropical Forest Forever Facility to fund, to pay to keep the trees. This is different from the question of money for carbon offsets, where money is given to countries to say, well, keep the trees from burning. In this case, they're talking about setting up, I don't know if it's a bank or an insurance policy that if a country shows that it hasn't cut its trees, it will get some money, very different. How can you police such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: It's going to depend on satellite observations of forest cover, because it has to be applied uniformly everywhere. We can't have independent agencies for every nation reporting. What we have to have is one tool that will tell us, and we all have to agree that that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: I mean, that seems like it could get tricky in terms of, what's the definition of healthy forest, and how do you tell if a forest, you know, has been slightly degraded, and then it starts being degraded more, and it, where's that tipping point, I guess, where's that, you know, slippery slope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: That is tricky. And again, I think this TFFF has been, is being launched, and it's, I think it's a great idea. The devil will be in the details. And those details have not been worked out. You know, it's a process, and making those decisions on what constitutes full forest, et cetera, et cetera still have not been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And by the way, what's in it for the people who are putting in money up front for this, what's the payout that they're going to receive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: It's a fund, so it's going to be invested. And from my understanding, then that means that there's a certain rate that goes to the investors, and there's a certain amount then that is set aside to go to the nations to pay for their forest. You know, there's the positive of that is because now, if you're not buying a credit, other players, other investors can get involved, say pension funds or insurance companies who aren't necessarily interested in offsetting carbon, they're interested in making a profit. So it brings other actors into the forest conservation realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Forest ecologist Dr. Michael Coe is a Senior Scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. He attended the COP30 climate talks in Belém, Brazil. (Photo: Sarah Moore)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-21/COP30_coe.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: You know, it appears to me a unique aspect of this is it's talking about some percentage of these funds being paid directly to indigenous peoples and local communities. How big a deal is this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: That's a big deal. Up to this point, it's been very difficult to find ways to include indigenous groups in the classic carbon credits, et cetera. So this whole idea is just very different. Instead of buying a credit, you're investing in a fund, and part of the profit of that fund goes to these nations for keeping forests in place, and part of that goes to people on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So we know that this tropical forest fund is in its early stages. There seems to be 5 or maybe $7 billion committed at a seed level. How excited are you about the possibilities of this fund?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: I'm actually very excited. This is a significant amount of money. I think that the way it's structured will attract more investors. I think there's a real possibility here that this could fund significant conservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So Mike, you're at COP30 right now. You've been going since the big meeting in Copenhagen back in 2009, and you've been in this business of climate research for a long time. What has the mood been like this year at the summit, and how are you feeling about the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: For me, this is, the mood here is wonderful. We've been trying for years to get forests, tropical forests in particular, as part of the agenda. Here in Brazil at COP30, they're really front and center. Forests are clearly an important part of our strategy. So for me, it's very positive. And you know, in terms of the future, I, it's a long slog we're on here. We have to keep trying, and we have to keep working and trying. This climate problem is not going to end tomorrow, and so these negotiations, these meetings, are extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Dr. Michael Coe is a Senior Scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And he's been on the line with us from Belém in Brazil at COP30. Thank you so much for taking the time with us today, Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COE: And thank you. It's been an absolute pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 is on track to be the warmest year in human history, according to the UK group Carbon Brief, which says it's likely the average global temperature increase over the preindustrial era will hit 1.57 degrees Centigrade, blowing through the Paris Climate target. Nature is already responding. The Atlantic hurricane season got off to a strong start with Beryl in July and as we prepare this broadcast the storm called Francine is raking the Gulf Coast, especially Louisiana. And in the meantime, California is getting scorched with triple the acreage of wildfires compared to 2023, with major fires also in Idaho, Oregon and Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Right, Steve, and as devastating as the fires in the US west are, this is also an especially bad year for fires in Brazil. Its National Institute for Space Research monitors fires and their data show that 2024 has had the most Amazonian wildfire outbreaks since 2005. And this wildfire epidemic is also raging in the Pantanal region of Brazil, which holds both the world’s largest tropical wetland and the world’s largest flooded grassland. Compared to roughly a hundred fires last August in the Pantanal, the data show nearly 4,000 in the same month this year. Much of this ties back to how Brazil is facing its worst drought since recordkeeping began over 70 years ago, so there’s a ton of dry, flammable plant material ready to burn. And on top of that, there’s a political dimension that leads to a lack of enforcement against the perpetrators who are setting many of these fires. I spoke to Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, which is a network of climate-focused civil society organizations. Marcio told me that even as the national government acts on slowing deforestation, it’s not enough to combat wildfires. I asked him what kind of approach the Brazilian government needs to make effective progress on stopping the burning in the Pantanal and the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-09-13/BRAZIL-pantanal.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASTRINI: It's a combination between federal government and local level. They must act together. When you're talking about like forest fires in places like Amazon, in Brazil, there are three main points that drive this forest fire situation. The first one is related to the climate. We have to have one climate that allows forest fires happens in those regions: dry season and high temperatures, mainly are. The second point is about having biomass. And the third one, criminals, we need someone to start the fire in the forest. It's impossible to the government to stop global warming alone, but the government can, for instance, ensure that those who are right now setting fire in the forest, are penalized, are persecuted. And it's really not happening in Brazil, because we don't have a law enough in Brazil, and even we have a lot of people who are under judgment for putting fire in the forest, but till now, no one was charged for that. So we have scenario where the impunity is the rule and the impunity is feeding the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Could you elaborate on how political leadership or lack thereof has shaped Brazil's environmental policy in the past couple of years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASTRINI: Politicians and the government in general way, they are absolutely necessary to make the situation on climate better or worse. Let's just give an example. Look for what's happening in the Amazon. The Amazon, 90% of deforestation is illegal. Doesn't matter if the government put the enforcement or field operation against criminals and are trying to halt deforestation, if the Congress is giving amnesty to the same criminals. If the Congress is given to the same criminals messages that they will not face any punishment. So even when Congress is analyzing one bill, one project law, it provides message to those who are acting in the field of the forest. The same we can say to the petrol industry, if the petrol industry, if they are having amnesties on that, if they are having this package of benefits coming from the government, they will be incentivized to continuously doing what they are doing. During Bolsonaro term, for instance, even the single speech coming from the former president Bolsonaro was enough to feed the destruction of the forest. When the Brazilian former president said, for instance, that the criminals were right and that the legislation in Brazil were wrong in terms of protecting forests in the country, of course, they were incentivizing the criminals in the country. Bolsonaro government decreased the capacity of the environmental agencies to operate and enforce the legislation in the country. So this situation makes scenario more comfortable to the criminals, to the mafia of deforestation, to invest in forest destruction. So it's absolutely important having one government committed to the legislation and applying the legislation in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Although Brazil’s government has worked towards reducing deforestation, it is not enough to halt these devastating fires. (Photo: Bruno Kelly, Amazônia Real, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-09-13/BRAZIL-deforestation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: I wanna zoom out a little bit and talk about Brazil's role in climate policy on a global stage. So, next year, Brazil will host COP 30, these UN climate talks. Marcio, what would you like to tell the global community about the role that Brazil can play in the fight against climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASTRINI: So, Brazil plays a very important role in the climate agenda. Brazil is very important in diplomatic issues and negotiations. Brazil is a very important country because he's one of the major emitter countries of carbon, and so Brazil contributes a lot for the current states of the climate around the world. Historically or currently, Brazil release a lot of greenhouse. And, so, to the Brazilian government or other countries, I would say, just... Climate crisis is about a social agenda. It's not about an environmentalist or diplomat trying to achieve an agreement in a closed room or something like that. It's a social issue, the poverty we raise a lot with climate crisis and the poor people around the world, exactly the people who will suffer the inequality. The climate crisis, the machine is a machine of poverty, is a machine of inequality, and we are seeing that's happening right now, and at time you are living right now. Climate crisis is no longer one prediction, no longer something that can happen in the future. It's happening right now. People are dying due climate crise, due climate change, and so there is no longer time to be waste discussing. It's just time to act right now. We have agreements enough, we have reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marcio Astrini is executive secretary of the Climate Observatory. (Photo: Courtesy of Marcio Astrini)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-09-13/BRAZIL-Marcio_Astrini.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have scientists saying what must be done in enough quantity to take action. There is no longer excuse on that. So, to the Brazilian government, to the US government, to the China government, to the India government, the Indonesia government, the Russia government doesn't matter where you are, all the countries needed to take action right now. Doesn't work as well just one country, like if a Brazil, or if Indonesia ended deforestation, if India, anywhere, and China, doesn't address the fossil fuels issue, because we're gonna lose the forest if we don't solve fossil fuels issue around the world. So, the Brazilian government has a very important situation hosting the COP 30. There are a lot of expectations over the climate conference in Brazil, and Brazilian government must have courage to push ahead the phase out fossil fuel agenda and showing that it's possible, also adopting important actions and measures internally, leading by example, and the best way to do that is ending deforestation mainly in the Amazons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists attending the 30th UN climate conference in Brazil are highlighting the alarming state of the cryosphere, or the frozen part of Earth covered in ice, snow, and permafrost. A recent report by the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative warns that “the European Alps, Rockies of the Western U.S. and Canada, Iceland, and Scandinavia would lose nearly all ice at 2°Celsius of warming.” And we’re on track for more than that at this point. Miriam Jackson is a glaciologist, climate scientist and the Eurasia and Nordic director of the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative. She’s there at COP30 and she joins me now. Welcome to Living on Earth, Miriam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSON: Thank you very much. Nice to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/cryosphere_river_melt.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: So what is the current state of the cryosphere right now? I know you just had a presentation at COP30, at the climate talks, about the cryosphere. What are we looking at here? Where does the cryosphere stand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSON: Very good question. So yes, I've actually just been given a presentation on tropical glaciers. The tropical glaciers are the ones that, you know, these low latitudes, in Peru, in Bolivia, in Ecuador, also in Africa. They're actually responding very quickly to climate change. They're at high elevation, and they're a little bit different than other glaciers, because they sort of get mass to get snow at any time of the year, and they can melt at anytime the year. And they're changing very quickly, probably, you know, more quickly than the global average. And we do see that globally, glaciers all over the world are changing fast, some areas faster than others. For example, the European Alps, the glaciers are changing very fast in parts of Norway, especially northern Norway, on Svalbard, up, you know, very high northerly latitudes. And it's actually quite interesting because it's a little bit unusual that when there has been climate change in the past, it's possibly a little bit different from one part of the world at the other. But what we're seeing now is something very similar over the whole world, that all the different glaciers, ones that, you know, very high latitudes, almost quite close to the North Pole. The ones at very high elevation, quite close to the equator, the ones in high mountain Asia a lot of these are generally 5000 meters and above. These are all changing. Some of them are changing quite slowly, and some of them are changing quite fast. But since the turn of the century, so since 2000, many of them have lost 20% of the mass, and some of them even more, and that's a huge amount, to use that much of the mass in just over 20 years. That's not sustainable. That kind of rates many glaciers are going to disappear very soon. Some glaciers have already disappeared. Venezuela, Slovenia lost their last glaciers quite recently. So this isn't something that we're saying this is going to happen. We should be careful. This is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: What are some of the impacts of melting glaciers on surrounding communities and on the world as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSON: We're seeing many different impacts from melting glaciers. The most immediate is people, especially in high mountain areas who use the water from melting glaciers for water supply. Hindu Kush, Himalaya, a lot of people there are very dependent on glaciers for melt water, for agriculture, for hydropower, also for tourism, also for spiritual reasons, glaciers means so much to so many people. And what we're seeing is that people are already being affected by glacier change now, and this is affecting monk communities the most, affecting them now. Also affecting a lot of people downstream who might live far from the glaciers, but especially in arid regions, you know, certain parts of Central Asia and northern Pakistan, it's very dry, but they depend on water from glaciers, also water from snow and they're really seeing changes now or their going to see them very soon. Also what we're seeing is that the glaciers are also it will affect the sea level because even though the mountain glaciers are small, they're already affecting how the water goes into the sea and causes sea level rise. And this affects everybody living in coastal communities, on low lying islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The largest and longest glacier of the Alps: the Aletsch Glacier seen from Eggishorn, Valais, Switzerland (Photo: Tobias Alt, Wikimedia Commons,CC BY-SA 4.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/cryosphere_alps.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And Miriam, what are glaciologists and cryosphere researchers pushing for at COP30?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSON: We're here for a few different reasons. Basically we're trying to, you know, to communicate information about the cryosphere. You know, the things I've just told you that these are the different ways the changes in glaciers are still affecting us. It's changes in water supply, it's hazards like the floods, it's sea level rise. And just trying to make sure that the negotiators understand the science that they have, they have the facts, they have the language that they need. We're working hard to get it in the text, and sometimes we do see that people in some parts of the world are thinking like why are we interested in sea ice? This doesn't affect us. You know, we're not in the Arctic, sea ice doesn't affect us. Changes in sea ice affect everybody, because this affects the albedo of the earth. As we lose sea ice, the earth gets warmer even faster. So we're trying to communicate this, that these are the facts about cryosphere, this is how fast it’s changing, this is how much the change is accelerating, and making sure that the policy makers here, the negotiators here, understand this, and they have the language also and the knowledge, so they can get this into the text, and we’ll if necessary, fight to keep it in the text, because there's always a lot of discussion on what should and shouldn't be in the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Artesena glacier in Ecuador taken by Miriam Jackson during a field trip before an IPPC lead author meeting in February 2018. (Photo: Miriam Jackson)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/cryosphere_artesena.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And you're currently at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, where these climate negotiations are taking place. It's been 30 years of climate negotiations. What are the sentiments there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JACKSON: Well, the sentiments here vary quite a lot. There's many countries, you know, there's countries like Tajikistan like Nepal, like Bhutan, that are really seeing the effects now of changes in the glaciers. They might have seen deaths from these glacially outburst floods, or they might just be seeing other floods that are caused by, you know, sudden rain on the snow and they're seeing all kinds of changes, so they're very concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Miriam Jackson is a glaciologist, climate scientist, the Eurasia and Nordic director of ICCI (International Cryosphere Climate Initiative) and the research scientist for the Norwegian Government at the Norwegian water sources and energy directorate. (Photo: Miriam Jackson)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/cryosphere_headshot.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the low lying island states, you know, they have a coalition, and they're very concerned as well, because, as they say, they've contributed the least to climate change but they're some of the ones who are suffering the most, and some of these islands are very low-lying, and they're thinking, will we even still be here by the end of the century? So they really feel the urgency. There's also a lot of countries here who export oil, and burning hydrocarbons is one of the main reasons for climate change, and a lot of them are quite reluctant to see the urgency. Obviously, their countries make a lot of money from exporting oil, so they want to keep on. And I think, to be honest, I think they don't really understand that this is something that’s going to affect everyone. There's no point in continuing to make money if the whole world is struggling so much with climate change that nobody's interested in buying oil anymore, they're just interested in survival. So it is frustrating here, and for some people, this is existential. Just because of disruptions globally, we have disruptions in trade as we have more people migrating because where they live, they can no longer live, they can no longer survive. So globally, it's going to affect everybody. And it's it is very hard trying to communicate this to some of the countries who possibly aren't immediately affected, but will be in the long run. But we keep on trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Miriam Jackson is a glaciologist, climate scientist, and the Eurasia and Nordic director of the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative. Thanks so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;

Marianne Lavelle, Washington bureau chief for our media partner, Inside Climate News, joins Hosts Aynsley O’Neill and Paloma Beltran to talk about the challenges of meeting those promises the new Governors-elect of Virginia and New Jersey, and the newly elected Mayor of New York, will likely face.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Paloma Beltran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And I’m Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paloma, I don’t need to tell you that there has been a lot of legislative and funding chaos in Washington DC recently, to put it mildly, and Democrats are struggling to retain some grip on political power during the Trump presidency and with Republicans at the reins in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: That’s right, Aynsley, and with all that division and infighting in Washington sucking up much of the political air, it can be easy to forget about the impact of local politics. But of course, what happens at the local and state level can make a huge difference, especially in the long run and when it comes to environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/LAVELLE-Rep._Abigail_Spanberger_-_118th_Congress.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Well November’s elections did bring notable victories and a sigh of relief for Democrats across the country, boosting the party’s optimism and generating questions about its future direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Now environmentalists are wondering to what extent addressing the climate crisis will be part of that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Here to talk to us about what to keep an eye on as these new leaders step into action is Marianne Lavelle, Washington bureau chief for our media partner, Inside Climate News. Welcome back to Living on Earth, Marianne!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So perhaps the result that got the most attention was the victory of 34-year-old Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as the next mayor of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Yeah, his campaign, which focused a lot on affordability for average New Yorkers, seemed to strike a positive chord, especially with young progressives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: But something that may or may not have gotten a little lost in the shuffle were his stances on climate issues. Marianne, how has Mamdani framed the climate crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Yes, I think it may have gotten lost because he didn't talk about it directly, but in the context of this greater affordability message, he would say when asked about it, climate and quality of life are not two separate concerns. They're one and the same. And I think the best example of how he framed the issue is he had this “Green Schools for a Healthier New York City” proposal. He wants a massive program of upgrading 500 schools. And this is a very popular idea, because everyone knows that those schools really need upgrades. And if they can upgrade the school buildings while improving energy systems and even adding solar and replace asphalt with green school yards, it could reduce costs as well as improving the schools, which is something that's long been needed. So it's kind of the win-win solution on climate and quality of life that he liked to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="​​New Jersey’s Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) has promised a utility rate freeze on her first day in office. (Photo: Joeshmonobody, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/LAVELLE-Mikie_Sherrill_Headshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And so now he's got a four-year term coming up. What will be the biggest challenges for a New York City mayor to deal with when it comes to climate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: There's no question that it's going to be all of those big buildings in New York City. The city actually in 2019, passed a law, one of the world's most ambitious city laws to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and 70% of those emissions come from big buildings. The landowners say this is going to be way too expensive for us. We're going to have to invest millions of dollars in these upgrades, and the current mayor, Eric Adams, had been working to ease the requirements for the real estate industry. What Mamdani has said is he's going to enforce the law, but he's going to find ways to make it affordable, to help the landlords pay for those upgrades. So he's going to use some existing programs to really give them, kind of a one stop shop for help on doing this. Tax breaks certainly could be a big part of that. That is an area where he's going to have this tension between affordability and climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: So where else might he encounter some tension between this push for affordability and development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Well, the natural gas industry is going to be wanting to build more pipelines and plants in New York and they argue that this is to make energy affordable and reliable. And right now, there's a big pipeline project that the governor approved just this week, and it's going to continue to be a big issue for New York City because it goes right by Staten Island and Rockaway Peninsula. The mayor is certainly going to be pulled into the debate over that infrastructure, and he says he doesn't want to see more natural gas infrastructure. The industry, meanwhile, will be saying, well, we're the industry that's going to make energy affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Peter Hubbard (D) was one of the Democrats elected to the Georgia Public Service Commission. It was the first time Democrats were elected to a state office since 2006. (Photo: TwiceBakedBean, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/LAVELLE-Peter_Hubbard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Sounds like he has his work cut out for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: He really does, and he's going to be watched closely, because other cities around the country and really around the world, they want to see if they can set similar goals on climate and really make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Well, there were a number of elections in other states and municipalities, and so what other leaders who were elected should we be paying attention to, Marianne?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Well, I definitely have an eye on Abigail Spanberger. She's the former Democratic member of Congress from Virginia who was just elected Virginia's new governor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And from what I understand, she will be the first female governor of the state, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: That's right. And Democrats also flipped 13 seats in their legislature, giving them a really solid majority in the state's House of Delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Wow. Well, what does this new balance of power mean for environmental policies in the state?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: For both Governor Spanberger and the legislature, there's going to be urgent, tough issues on a massive amount of new data center proposals, these big data centers that are necessary for artificial intelligence. Right now, Virginia is the number one state in data center capacity. Northern Virginia is actually the number one market in the world. Only Beijing is second for these big data centers. And there are proposals out there to add four times the current capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And now Marianne remind us why these data centers are a cause for so much environmental concern?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Well, there's a lot of questions, including the footprint of the centers and also their water use, but probably the biggest questions have to do with their huge energy use. In 2020 Virginia's Clean Economy Act was passed, and that was meant to decarbonize the state's electric grid by 2050 but how can the state reduce its fossil energy as the law calls for when it's seeing all this new demand from the data centers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Well, I know Spanberger's platform included talk about lowering energy costs and producing more energy in Virginia. How did she propose to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: She'd like to see a big build out of solar and battery storage in Virginia, and she's also a big proponent of offshore wind, but all of the offshore wind projects require federal approvals, and she's going to face opposition from the Trump administration on that. There could be a similar situation like we've seen in New York, where the President pressures the governor to get concessions and agree to natural gas build out in return for his approval of wind projects. So that's definitely a thing to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: All right, well, Marianne, as many of our listeners know, I am a proud Jersey girl, and we just elected a new governor, Democrat Mikie Sherrill. What promises has she made along the lines of energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Well, she promises to put a freeze on utility rates on her first day in office, and then begin a massive build out of new electricity sources. New Jersey has had one of the highest run ups in electricity bills in the country, up about 20% in one year, and she said, we need more power, and we need to know more about how the utility companies are using this money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And to what extent is Governor-elect Sherrill proposing renewable energy expansion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: She definitely wants to see solar and battery power to be a big emphasis. She also is a proponent of offshore wind. Her opponent was going to put a ban on offshore wind. So that's a big difference that New Jersey voters voted for. There still is going to be pressure to expand natural gas, just as in the other states. New Jersey has a lot of nuclear power, and she wants to build on that, and she said that also is a way to expand energy and keep carbon emissions down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marianne Lavelle is the Washington Bureau Chief for our media partner, Inside Climate News. (Photo: Courtesy of Marianne Lavelle)" src="https://loe.org/content/2014-12-05/LIMA--marianne.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Yeah, and Marianne, I also heard that the Georgia Public Service Commission election was somewhat of a shock, with Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson securing two seats on the Commission. What was going on there, do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Absolutely, it was a big deal. And the Georgia Public Service Commission, not many people usually keep track of that office, but it's a big office for deciding utility rates, and people were pretty fed up with a whole bunch of increases in their electricity bills. So the same issue that we've seen in New Jersey, in Virginia, in New York: energy affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Yeah, that really seems to be sort of a common theme out there, Marianne. What else have you seen across these various different political landscapes when it comes to climate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Well, one thing that I think you're going to hear throughout the coming year is tying these rising energy and electricity rates to the Trump administration policies. We've had electricity rates increasing even before Trump took office, but things like shutting down offshore wind, forcing old coal plants to run even though they're problematic. You're going to hear opponents of the Republicans be bringing this up over and over again, that clean energy is cheaper energy, and that is really going to be a theme in these political races in the coming years that could help decide control of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: We will definitely have to keep tabs on these new leaders and new policies on the road to midterms just one year away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAVELLE: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Marianne Lavelle is the Washington bureau chief for our media partner Inside Climate News. Thanks so much for taking the time with us, Marianne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;

As habitat loss linked to climate change, forest fires, and deforestation threatens these pollinators and honey makers, a new and innovative law in Peru has granted these bees legal rights to help protect them and the indigenous people living with them. Reporter Teresa Tomassoni of our media partner Inside Climate News speaks with Host Aynsley O’Neill about the remarkable relationship between these bees and people.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Most of us are familiar with a few key facts about honeybees; they live in hives, they pollinate our food, and they sting. But hundreds of honeybee species don’t actually have that stinger we know from European honeybees, though they do still live in hives and pollinate crops. One of the places you can find these stingless bees is in the Peruvian Amazon, where the local Asháninka people have developed a sort of symbiotic relationship with the bees and their honey. But habitat loss linked to climate change, forest fires, and deforestation is posing an existential threat to these bees and indigenous communities. Teresa Tomassoni of our media partner Inside Climate News reported on a new, first-of-its-kind Peruvian law that gives these stingless bees legal rights to help protect them. She’s here to give us the buzz—Teresa, welcome to Living on Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Teresa, tell us: what is a stingless bee? What sets these bees apart from the ones that we might be familiar with here in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: Stingless bees, as the name suggests, either don't have stingers or have stingers that lack the ability to cause pain. Now that doesn't mean that they can't cause a little bit of harm now and then by biting. For the most part, these bees are very sweet and gentle, as the Asháninka people taught me. That's why they call one of the species angelitas, which means little angels. These stingless bees are key pollinators in the Amazonian ecosystems. They are contributing to the pollinization of at least 75% of agricultural crops in the region. One of the reasons that stingless bees are so not well known is they're tiny. They are often dismissed as flies or wasps. People don't know the major role that they play in pollinating the Amazon rainforest, the lungs of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/BEES-honey.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And you were on the ground in Peru for about two weeks reporting on these bees. Can you tell us a little bit about that experience? You know, what's it like in that region of Peru? And who were some of the people that you actually spoke to there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: It was such an incredible experience. You know, I've been to the Amazon various times, but I've always been close to the Amazon River. We were actually in the central Peruvian Amazon. So we were in a region that's higher altitude. We were climbing up steep mountain paths, taking a moment to catch our breath as we're hiking uphill. The first time I saw the stingless bees happened in the Indigenous Asháninka community of Pichiquía, located along the Ene river. Doctora Rosa Espinoza, another entomologist who's Peruvian and Indigenous as well, César Delgado and some of the other Asháninka community members who have been practicing stingless beekeeping, which is called meliponiculture, arranged to facilitate a workshop in the community center where they showed off two bee boxes, which they called cajas in Spanish. And when I watched Doctora Rosa Espinoza and another woman featured in my article, Micaela Huaman, open that first hive, I was just amazed, because this hive looked very different from the honeycomb hives many of us have seen. This hive looked like a soccer ball riddled with kind of craters, almost like a planet. It was very globular and had these cavities. And what is super interesting is these stingless bees create these grape sized honey pods where they put their honey in, and that's where the honey is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And well, of course, I have to hear even more about this honey. I'm hoping you had a taste test that you can maybe share with us. What did you learn about this honey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: This honey is not like any honey that you would buy in a store, at least in the United States, right? This honey has a high water content. It's a little bit sour or acidic. Some of it is sweet. It's both sweet and sour. It goes down very easily. It doesn't stick to the back of your throat. It's not gooey. It goes down almost like a spoonful of medicine. And in fact, it is highly medicinal, which Indigenous people, the Indigenous Asháninka and other Indigenous groups throughout the Amazon have known for millennia. They've used it to treat a wide array of illnesses, and now scientists like Doctora Rosa Espinoza and César Delgado are just confirming that in their laboratories by doing these chemical analyses of these honeys and finding that they have anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, even anti-viral properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In 2025, Dr. Rosa Vásquez Espinoza, along with members of Amazon Research International and Earth Law Center, held a number of workshops on the Rights of Nature, particularly on their efforts to have the Peruvian government declare rights for stingless bees in the Amazon, alongside the Asháninka community.

&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So, Teresa, tell us about the process of stingless beekeeping. How does it work exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: First you have to find the bees. Even in the best of conditions, it's not easy to find them. Their nests are not just hanging from trees. They're hidden inside the trees. They're hidden inside rotten logs. Some Indigenous peoples like this park ranger, Richar, listens for the bees. He can stand still in the forest and attune his ear into the sound of stingless bees, which I find quite incredible, and then follow that sound to the nest. But to access the nest even once you know where it is, is not easy. What I'm told is that historically, these nests were removed from a tree by chopping the entire tree down, which, as you can imagine, is not the most sustainable thing to do in the Amazon rainforest when we're trying to preserve habitat. And so the Asháninka people have developed a new method of basically cutting out a small section in the tree in a way that doesn't harm the tree permanently. They can detect where the nest is basically by knocking on the tree, again by sound. Once that nest is put into the bee box, they leave that box near the tree to, with the hopes that they're going to attract the bees back. They're going to then find this box with a little bit of honey around its entrance, and hope is that they enter and begin working in their hive once again. Once they see that the bees are thriving in that bee box, usually about a week after they've been removed from their natural habitat, they'll move that box to another area, either into a community or near a garden plot that they want more pollinators in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Asháninka leader, César Ramos shows onlookers how to sustainably remove a wild stingless bee nest without fully cutting down the tree housing it. In the modern age, the Asháninka people and other local communities are cultivating stingless bees in wooden bee boxes, helping to multiply the hives and repopulate the species. (Photo: Teresa Tomassoni, Inside Climate News)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/BEES-stingless bees Cesar Ramos.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And what about the role that they play in local culture? How do stingless bees, and I guess stingless beekeeping, fit into the local Indigenous communities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: The Asháninka people have a very strong relationship with the stingless bees. They call them their ancestors. They say we live with the bees. The bees live with us. And so for thousands of years, they say their ancestors have relied on the bees to provide honey that helps them treat a variety of illnesses. The Indigenous peoples really credit the stingless bees for helping them survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: So your reporting talks about a new declaration that came out of the Peruvian government that actually gives these bees legal rights. Now, for those of us who might not know why this is, how would you explain what it means for an insect to be granted legal rights like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: So before last year, the Peruvian government didn't even acknowledge that stingless bees existed as a species within their country. They had no legal protections whatsoever, even though European honeybees, apis mellifera, did. So, what Doctora Rosa Espinoza, Earth Law Center, other scientists in the Asháninka people really advocated for was first a national law that recognized these bees exist in our country, but then they wanted to strengthen that law to go a step further by acknowledging these insects as inherent holders of legal rights. And so this next step is based on a growing “rights of nature” movement, which is a legal and philosophical framework that is really meant to strengthen and reframe how we protect the environment. And so this new declaration actually was developed in collaboration with Asháninka leaders and community members. It also mentions that the indigenous people's rights are inextricably connected with those of the stingless bees. They acknowledge that the indigenous people's culture, their spiritual beliefs, are very much intertwined with the well-being of the stingless bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And what kind of threats are they facing that really inspired this push to protect them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: As we know throughout the Amazon, deforestation is one of the number one threats to habitat and species. We are seeing illegal logging happening rampantly throughout the Amazon, but particularly in this region of Junín. We're seeing large areas of land clearing happening to make way for other agriculture, cattle grazing, even illicit coca crops, so their habitat is being largely wiped out. And then we have climate change, which is raising temperatures in these typically cooler environments, as I mentioned, in this part of the Amazon, forcing the bees to move higher, further away from communities that are used to depending on them, and harvesting their honey for medicine, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Asháninka stingless beekeeper Micaela Huaman Fernandez inspects a hive of Tetragonisca angustula bees. (Photo: Teresa Tomassoni, Inside Climate News)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/BEES-stingless bees Fernandez.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: And so what kind of impact do you see these new legal rights having, not just on the bees themselves, but in the local culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: What I'm hearing from Rosa Espinoza, for example, is that the government of Satipo will implement this local law by designating or funneling funds to local communities to be trained in meliponiculture, in the practice of stingless beekeeping. But the sources of income are very limited in this region, and so by training them in stingless beekeeping, by giving them the materials, could open up a whole new opportunity for earning income in this particular area. We're already seeing this happen in other regions of the Peruvian Amazon. The other part of this implementation is very much focused on restoration. So the scientists, the Asháninka leaders, are really hoping that investments will be made in restoring areas that have been degraded by illegal logging, by wildfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: Well, so Teresa, some might say, okay, cool, fun facts we now know that a stingless bee exists, but what's the impact here? What's the importance here? Why would you say that people globally should care about these stingless bees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOMASSONI: I think it's important to note that we are facing a global crisis in losing our pollinators, from our butterflies to our honeybees to the stingless bees in the Peruvian Amazon. Losing our pollinators affects us all. This affects the agricultural crops that we depend on for our food. It affects the availability of medicinal plants, and so the stingless bee is a unique case study in which to set our eyes on and learn from and acknowledge what can happen when their habitat disappears. When it's cleared, those pollinators disappear, and then what happens? We lose those medicinal plants. We lose the potential to pollinate the crops that large populations also depend on throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEILL: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Aynsley O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And I’m Paloma Beltran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s UN climate talks are underway in Belém, the “gateway to the Amazon” in Brazil. And with nations’ pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions way off track from where they need to be to meet key climate goals, frustrations have boiled over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SOUNDS OF PROTEST]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: On the second day of COP30, protesters led by Indigenous peoples including the Tupinambá diverted from a government-approved protest route and stormed past security into the COP30 venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SOUNDS OF PROTEST]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: An Indigenous leader identified by the Guardian as Cacique Gilson wore a blue feathered headdress and spoke during the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[INDIGENOUS MAN SPEAKING]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VOICEOVER: We don’t eat money. We want our territory free. But the business of oil exploration, mineral exploration, and logging continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Longtime climate talk observer and Senior Associate for E3G Alden Meyer is there at this COP and witnessed some of the commotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: I think it just shows you know that you can't keep the outside concerns and passions of people from affecting the process here. This was a particularly dramatic way of doing that, and just a symbol of how much the outcome of these talks means to people because they see how it's directly affecting their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-14/MEYER-competing interests.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Indigenous communities play crucial roles in protecting ecosystems around the world. Brazil is establishing an initiative called the Ethical Stocktake to call attention to the disproportionate effect that the climate crisis is having on marginalized communities, including Indigenous people. How could this shape COPs going forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, it's a very interesting process. It's been led by Marina Silva, the Environment Minister of Brazil, as well as her counterpart, the Indigenous Minister of Brazil, has been very engaged in this, Sônia Guajajara, and they have held a number of dialogues and meetings around the world in this Ethical Stocktake process, engaging not just Indigenous communities, but scientists, artists, poets, ethicists, people from all walks of life, to try to say, what is our moral responsibility to impacted people, to future generations, to achieve the kind of outcomes we need in this process? They have provided an input to this process. It's not a negotiated input. It was developed based on the consultations they had around the world over the last year or so. But it really is a voice for morality and ethics and the rights of impacted people, both now and in the future, and I think it is making a difference in the way that they're perceived. Brazil also, the presidency has made an unprecedented effort to engage Indigenous communities and people in this process in terms of observer status, participation in dialogues, et cetera. You know, it's still not enough. It's not everything the Indigenous people constituency in this process would like to see, but I think it is a step forward, and I think it's going to be pretty hard for future COP presidencies to try to roll that back and do less to reflect the interests of those communities in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="​​Sonia Guajajara leads the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil. She worked on the Global Ethical Stocktake, an initiative to prioritize the needs of marginalized people in the fight against climate change.

&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: So COP is being hosted in Brazil this year, which is an interesting dynamic. On the one hand, Brazil has made efforts to preserve its rainforest ecosystem, but deforestation continues, and the nation is also exploring the possibility of drilling for oil in the Amazon region. How is Brazil navigating its place at this year's climate talks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, this is a sort of inherent contradiction in a lot of countries, including some of the most recent hosts of the COPs. On the one hand, you're seeing a long-term commitment to transitioning away from fossil fuels. We have to get to net zero emissions by mid-century. That's not that far away anymore. On the other hand, you see short term economic development and energy security imperatives which are driving not just Brazil, but many other countries to continue to develop and produce oil, coal and gas, despite their long-term commitments to phasing out those energy sources. And of course, here in Brazil, it's not just oil drilling. You see dramatic expansion of beef production, of soybean production, which are putting strains on the rain forest, on the Amazon. This is true in other countries as well. I think the US is the leading developer and exporter now of fossil fuels and in terms of projected development, particularly around liquefied natural gas. You also see that with other producing countries in the north, like the UK and Norway and Canada and Australia. And of course, you're seeing countries in Africa and elsewhere moving to exploit their fossil fuel resources. So this is sort of an inherent contradiction. We're trying to manage a transition away from what has powered the Industrial Revolution and fired up economies over the last century, and we're trying to do it in an unprecedentedly rate of speed and short amount of time to make that transition. So, there are strains and contradictions in the system. I don't think it has impacted the ability of the Brazilian presidency and their very experienced team of diplomats to manage this process. They're doing a very skillful job. But just like any other country, there are different forces at play, and there are very powerful interests in Brazil, in the energy sector, in the agriculture sector, in the mining sector, that don't want to change the current rules and ways of doing business because that would impact their business models and their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And, Alden, I do want to ask you, what's been the presence of the fossil fuel industry at this year's climate talks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, the fossil fuel industry has been in this process since the very beginning. They are definitely here in force. They are represented both in terms of investor-owned companies like the big petro chemical companies and oil producers and coal producers, but of course, they're also represented by many of the state owned companies that produce coal, oil and gas and the exporting countries, particularly the Arab region, but others, so they are definitely present. There is going to be a big fight over how specific we can get on implementing the consensus decision from two years ago on the need to transition away from fossil fuels in the energy sector. At that decision in Dubai, at COP 28, we were able to get specific commitments to triple production of renewable energy by 2030 and to double the rate of energy efficiency improvement from around 2% a year to 4% a year by 2030, but we were not able to get any benchmarks or quantification of the transition away from fossil fuels. So there are discussions here about the need to set up a process and a roadmap forward on how to implement that decision. Brazil is talking with people about that. Colombia has put forward a proposal on this. Other countries are talking about it. But the more specific you get on that, the more vociferous the opposition will be from both the privately owned companies and the oil, gas and coal producing countries. So talk to me after the end of next week, and we'll see what we get out of here. But this is definitely going to be a very live issue over the next 10 or 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Meyer says that the COP process is a mirror to what happens in each individual country. He believes that, in order to make change, people must make their interests known in their home countries.

&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: Decade after decade, countries have promised to address the climate crisis, but scientists say that limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius will be impossible without urgent action. What signs do you see that countries might bridge the gap between motivation and action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, let me first talk about the science, because I think we have seen a shift here. Even the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, in his speech at the Leaders Summit, acknowledged that it is virtually certain at this point that we are going to overshoot the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal in Paris, at least for a period of time. But he said that doesn't mean we give up on it. We have to try to limit the magnitude and the duration of that overshoot, and we need to make sure that we return to staying under 1.5 degrees, no later than the end of the century. So that's already a recalibration of the goal, so to speak, just because of the fact we've done so little in the last 20 or 30 years to constrain emissions of greenhouse gasses. On your question, though, I think it's a mixed bag. We see some of the national commitments that were put forward in the run up to this meeting as being fairly ambitious and really putting pressure on various sectors and their economy to decarbonize. We see others that are basically business as usual. We have seen the rise of the business and states and mayors and other sub national actors. They are also here in force. There's a component of these process here in in Belém called the action agenda, which Brazil has made a centerpiece of their COP, to try to accelerate action by states and cities and investors and businesses and others. That I think is paying off, and there's a chance that that can help close some of the ambition gap. The report that was just put out, the updated report by the UNFCCC Secretariat earlier this week, reflecting the latest state of play in terms of country submissions, pledges, showed that we were on track to cut emissions only by 12% below 2019 levels by 2035 compared to the 60% or more that scientists say we need to do if we're going to have any chance of staying on track for the Paris temperature goals. So we're only doing about 1/5 of what we need to do. I think we will see some incremental progress here on some of these fronts. We're going to see some announcements on methane, on forests, on energy, on other sectors, but they're going to be nowhere near what is needed to close the gap. So we're going to come out of the limb with a lot more work to do if we want to limit temperature increases even to well below two degrees, much less 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, believes that even though we will likely overshoot the 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming threshold set by the Paris Agreement, we should aim to keep global temperatures to a minimum.

&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: There's a push to decarbonize the global economy, but rare earth metals are often extracted through harmful mining practices. To what extent is there a conversation about a just transition in the mining sector at this year's COP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, the issue of just transition is front and center in the negotiations, not just on the mining sector, but the energy sector, large industries, forests, agriculture, land use, you name it. It's a dominant theme here. Of course, it's a very complicated and complex space, but I think we will see a fairly significant decision on this front at the end of next week. We'll see how far we can get in terms of moving just from two dialogs a year on just transition, which is the current state of affairs, to a more proactive set of institutional arrangements to advance just transition in the country and community level, but that's one of the issues here. The critical minerals and mining issue has also received a lot of attention. In the UN process, there's a commission led by the Secretary General and other elements of the United Nations looking at responsible mining practices. That's not my area of expertise, but I know colleagues who are involved in that that think it's a very constructive discussion. Of course, implementation of any criteria for responsible mining is at the national level. And just like on emissions of carbon dioxide or production of plastics or anything else, the UN can't impose obligations on countries, but there is a lot of work going on, I think, in that process and in other areas to try to deal with the impacts of increased mining and production of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BELTRAN: And Alden, you mentioned, the world is way off target in reaching climate goals, and there are big questions about the usefulness of the COP process itself. You've watched this process play out for three decades now. What's your take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alden Meyer is a Senior Associate at E3G working on US and international climate policy and politics. He is a Principal at Performance Partners, which provides a range of consulting services to clients in government, business, and the non-profit sector.

&lt;p&gt;MEYER: Well, it's not a perfect process, but it is the one place where the nations of the world and people of the world from all constituencies come together every year to reflect on how well we're doing and to try to figure out how we can do more to deal with the climate emergency. There really is no other venue. If we did not have this process, we'd have to reinvent it. The COPs and the negotiations are basically a mirror that we hold up to ourselves each year to reflect how we're doing as a species in dealing with this unprecedented emergency. And if the image that we see in the mirror appears a little ugly, it doesn't do a lot of good to blame the mirror. The problem is not the UNFCCC, the UN process, or the negotiations, there are ways to improve that, and some of those are being discussed. The problem is the lack of political will, in all too many countries, to make the tough decisions to protect people's lives. The problem is the dominance of the fossil fuel industry and other special interests in this process over the last 30 years, putting their short-term profit interests ahead of the well-being of their own people, and that's what we have to address. We need more profiles and political courage by leaders. We need more people stepping up to demand action, and most of that has to happen back in capitals and back in countries before delegations arrive at these COPs. What you see here is a reflection of the positions that have been negotiated and determined among the powerful countries before they send their negotiators to the COPs. And you can't just show up at a COP in Belém or Dubai or London or anywhere else, and expect to get instant change. You have to work hard for it in the months ahead at home, if you're going to affect the position of countries. And I think people are, are realizing that, and we're seeing some of that reflected in these hallways, but nowhere near enough.&lt;/p&gt;

Producer El Wilson, who has cerebral palsy, and producer Jenni Doering test an offroad wheelchair and meet a woman who has been able to reclaim the joy and freedom of hiking since becoming disabled.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Hiking season is coming to an end in the cooler parts of the northern Hemisphere. Unless you’re into winter hiking. But for some folks with disabilities, hiking any time of the year can be difficult to impossible, putting nature out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: The good news though is that people who advocate for “trails for all” and adaptive devices and programs are helping to change that. So here’s an encore of our story about accessible trails and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: It’s Living on Earth. I’m El Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And I’m Jenni Doering. El is a producer here at Living on Earth who uses they/them pronouns. But you rarely hear their voice on the show. That’s because El has cerebral palsy, or CP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Cerebral palsy is a disorder you’re born with that changes the way your brain controls your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: In addition to how CP affects El’s voice, they have a hard time balancing. So, El uses a manual wheelchair to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX OF EL’S EVERYDAY WHEELCHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s not like a standard-issue wheelchair you’d see in a hospital or an airport. It was custom built to fit and be powered by El, who’s pretty small and lean. This wheelchair can cruise down the Boston hills, give rides to El’s fluffy orange cat, Cleo, and pop wheelies on the dance floor - to Taylor Swift, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX OF EL’S EVERYDAY WHEELCHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: But one thing it just can’t do is go offroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX OF GRIT WHEELCHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: So, on this warm sunny day, El and I have come out to Mount Tom North Trailhead Park in western Massachusetts to learn how people with mobility challenges can explore the outdoors. El is going to take an offroad wheelchair for a spin, so they push out of their usual chair and with a bit of help ease into a more rugged rig called a Grit Freedom Chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX - EL GETTING INTO CHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Now today we’re not just tooling around on a flat patch of dirt. We’re on a new accessible trail that heads up a hill, so El is in for a workout! But I’m confident El can do it, and the Grit chair looks up to the challenge. The tires are wider than the ones on El’s usual chair and the front wheels stick out far in front, so it doesn’t tip forward. And instead of simply rolling the wheels, El is going to push and pull two levers that allow a seated hiker to winch up a hill like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-10-11/TRAILS_amy.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX GRIT CHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: We might need the lesson on how to use it, actually, from Amy over there…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: …because this is her chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Karen Foster, Executive Director of All Out Adventures, points us toward a woman with a slight frame like El’s with brown hair and an outdoorsy vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: Hi, I’m Amy Sugihara, participant with All Out Adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Amy is maybe twice El’s age at around 50 and about 8 years ago she was diagnosed with a degenerative disease. So now she uses a manual wheelchair to get around town and the Grit chair for hiking. Like a lot of adaptive sports equipment, Grit Freedom chairs come with a hefty price tag. They cost three to six thousand or so, more than your average manual chair. The VA will cover the cost of a chair for eligible veterans. And others can apply for funding through state grants and nonprofits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX GRIT CHAIR]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: The makers of the Grit chair claim it’s twice as efficient as an everyday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wheelchair because of how it uses those levers, attached to gears that turn the wheels. It’s kind of like the difference between climbing a hill on a bike with gears versus a fixie. In fact, the Grit Chair uses bike parts so it’s much easier to repair than a typical wheelchair. But just like riding a bike… it takes practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Okay, how does it feel so far?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Hard ‘cause it’s like a muscle group I don’t use, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: What you need to know is that El is an athlete who plays sled hockey, a full contact sport played on the ice that can get just as intense as the sport the Bruins play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX - EL GOING UP THE HILL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: But this is still hard work. The crushed stone trail starts out in a meadow and soon climbs into the dappled light of the forest, giving us welcome shade. To make the trail accessible, the path is relatively even, it never gets too steep, and it has flat rest areas that follow each incline. Without accessible trails like this one, hiking would remain inaccessible for many with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX - EL GOING UP THE HILL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Now, you might be wondering as I did – why isn’t it paved, if it’s meant to be an accessible trail? Karen Foster says what she’s learned in her work helping people of all abilities experience the outdoors is that unpaved trails can be better than pavement in a lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: It’s so different being in the woods on an unpaved trail – you know, all the sensory benefits, it’s cooler, we’re in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: You feel more connected to the outdoors when you’re on a trail with a more natural surface like crushed stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX - EL GOING UP THE HILL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: But you also feel the burn, and in the Grit Chair, El is struggling and gratefully accepts Karen’s offer to help push. As we all take a much-needed rest on the way up the mountain, Amy Sugihara tells us she used to take on much more difficult trails than this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUGIHARA: My mobility has been declining gradually over the last ten years. So, I used to be a big hiker, when I was able-bodied. And then as my mobility declined, my world just kind of closed in. And I didn’t think I could hike anymore. I mean it just; it didn’t occur to me that there were ways to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Now, this might be El’s first-time hiking since their dad could give piggy-back rides, but “getting out” has never been a problem. El has always had CP, and they were always told, you can do anything with the right attitude and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Oh yeah, water skiing, rock climbing, zip lining, wheelchair lacrosse, wheelchair basketball, and sled hockey, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unpaved accessible trails allow people with disabilities to access more natural landscapes than paved trails do. (Photo: Karen Foster, All Out Adventures)" src="https://loe.org/content/2024-10-11/TRAILS_unpaved.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Nothing felt out of reach for El. But Amy had to adjust to a new life without the abilities she’d always taken for granted. So, at first, she felt really stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUGIHARA: I searched online looking for… outdoor… I don’t remember what I put in exactly, probably “outdoor adventure,” and All Out Adventures popped up. ‘Cause I wanted to do something with my son who was then going into eighth grade. And it was like, “No way! Oh, my goodness!” And I called because I saw their recumbent trike program in the summer. And I thought, “Oh, my son and I could do this together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX PHONE RINGING]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUGIHARA: And Karen answered the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX PHONE RINGING]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: When I get to be the person on the phone that says, “Yes,” or grab the right piece of Velcro or the right bike pedals or know the piece of equipment that’s gonna work for somebody… And then I see spouses off on a bike ride together or siblings, you know, ice skating and playing chase. And when I get to see those connections in action, it’s kinda everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And for Amy, being able to experience the outdoors with her family again changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUGIHARA: And it just completely opened up my world. I think we all gain a lot from being outside in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Like Amy I love to hike, and before today it had never quite sunk in for me that we don’t all have equal access to the outdoors. El says that can be a tendency for a lot of us able-bodied folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: All of you take everything for granted all the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX – EL GOING UP THE HILL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: At last, by wheel and on foot, we make our way to the top, to a clearing overlooking the Connecticut River Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: This is the view we’ve been hiking for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: It’s so green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: What do you think, El?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: Beautiful. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: As we take in the view, we have a moment to chat with Karen about who All Out Adventures serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: One of the things that people don’t necessarily understand about our programs is that only about half of our participants actually have disabilities. And the other half are their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And it turns out, there are a lot more people who can benefit from accessible trails like this one than you might think. Pregnant people, anyone pushing a stroller, elders, and more. But Karen says these trails won’t get built without able-bodied folks stepping up as allies to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTER: People who don’t have disabilities are the more visible trail users. So, the more they advocate for the full inclusion of everybody in trail design and trail use, that’s really significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Life has gotten better for people who use wheelchairs since the Americans with Disabilities Act became law in 1990. But there’s still a long and bumpy road ahead to breaking down barriers. And for El and me it’s a long road back home to Boston so we need to get going. And El’s cruise back down the trail offers a chance to test out just how fast the Grit Chair can go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SFX: EL GOES ZOOM]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Having to run to keep up! But you just go! There they go, off down the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX OF JENNI RUNNING TO KEEP UP WITH EL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[SFX OF GRIT CHAIR GOING DOWNHILL]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Wow! Did you get some adrenaline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILSON: [LAUGHS] Uh hah, that was really fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUGIHARA: You know, the more we with disabilities go out into the world and live our lives, the better it is for everybody. I think we’re all better off.&lt;/p&gt;

Marianna Kuttothara is Head of Health, Disaster, Climate and Crisis for the Americas at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and joins Host Jenni Doering to talk about the aid efforts, long road to recovery, and importance of building back better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: It’s Living on Earth, I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_barnes.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate crisis made Hurricane Melissa worse in every aspect, according to scientists at World Weather Attribution. The rapid intensification, prodigious rainfall, and blistering winds were all fueled by warmer than normal air and ocean water, conditions that climate disruption makes six times more likely. The storm was a catastrophic Category 5 with 185 mile an hour winds when it made landfall in Jamaica and for the people there it was a very long and harrowing night. Makare Barnes lives in Westmoreland Parish on the hard-hit West Coast of Jamaica and heard trees snapping all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAKARE: There's nothing you can do. You're just hoping that none falls on your house, which it did. My neighbor tree fell on mine. But we’re safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Makare works at a resort near the town of Black River, which was almost totally destroyed, and many of his coworkers lost their homes after the ferocious wind ripped their roofs right off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAKARE: They told me like they hear the whistling. And then the roof just -- [SNAPS FINGERS] -- went away. Just went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: By the time the storm got to Cuba the wind speed had slowed to 120 miles an hour, but it was still a major Category 3 hurricane causing extensive damage. And the rain absolutely poured down. With the relief and recovery effort now underway, to learn more especially about the situation in Cuba we’re joined by Marianna Kuttothara, Head of Health, Disaster, Climate and Crisis for the Americas at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. So Marianna, can you walk us through the steps taken to assist in the immediate aftermath of this storm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marianna Kuttothara, Head of Health, Disaster, Climate and Crisis for the Americas at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. (Photo: Courtesy of IFRC)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_kuttothara.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: Yeah, I can say, well, the first thing is to check that everyone's okay. Immediately, the priorities were to send teams to see what the situation was, provide food, water, shelter. So Jamaica Red Cross was also helping manage shelters in the immediate aftermath. And Cuban Red Cross as well, they not only supported with preventive evacuations, but also there were evacuations that were happening right after to prevent people from being in further distress. One of the key needs that's emerging both in Cuba and Jamaica, and was probably one of the first actions, was also providing mental health and psychosocial support. So both Jamaica and Cuba are, unfortunately not strangers to hurricanes. We see that Melissa is hitting Jamaica just 16 months after Hurricane Beryl, and in Cuba, Melissa is striking just a year after Hurricane Oscar, right? So this level of catastrophe and damage also brings a lot of trauma and need for not just the physical well-being, but also the mental health support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Where did hurricane Melissa hit Cuba hardest? And what is it like in those areas right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cuban Red Cross helped rescue hundreds of stranded people when the Cauto River flooded in the wake of Hurricane Melissa. (Photo: Courtesy of IFRC)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_redcross.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: So hurricane Melissa hit Cuba on the eastern side of Cuba, it actually made landfall in Santiago de Cuba. And I want to again highlight that this were areas that had been just a year ago affected by Hurricane Oscar. But there is also arbovirus outbreak that had been declared. So that's like dengue, chikungunya and other vector carrying diseases, or puche is another one. So this is a compounded disaster, so to speak, right? Part of the reason why it's hard to get as much information as connectivity, right? So power outages were already a challenge, and even more so now. But similarly, there are situations where communities have been cut off because of landslides and access, or just poor road conditions, houses that are quite destroyed, if not completely destroyed, health needs that were already existing, but also access to safe water is a challenge. And then there's also concern about just health issues being further exacerbated, the existing health issues now that there's standing water and these vector borne diseases are likely to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Extensive flooding in the province of Granma has destroyed property and crops, leaving many people homeless. (Photo: Courtesy of IFRC)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_extensiveflooding.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Can you tell us what you've heard about someone in Cuba who is actually there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: Yeah, we have a colleague who is based in our Santo Domingo office who is currently in Cuba. He traveled in the immediate aftermath, and he was telling us, yeah, precisely this, just seeing the trauma in people's faces, the despair, the need for support. I think sometimes we also focus on just the sadness of the situation. But he was also impressed by the incredible work that the Cuban Red Cross is doing, immediately mobilizing, helping communities, coordinating with local authorities and other community organizations to take people out of their homes, ensure that they're provided with essential relief items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And I understand that the recovery effort that the Red Cross is embarking on, you're looking at 24 months of doling out this aid. I mean, I know it takes a long time to recover from this kind of a disaster. Why does it take so long for people to get back on their feet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Recovery efforts are well underway in Jamaica, where Red Cross volunteers work with those whose homes sustained heavy damage in Hurricane Melissa. (Photo: Courtesy of IFRC)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_recovery.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: Yeah, I would say that there's kind of two phases, right, the relief phase, as we say, which is the immediate needs and then, as you rightly mentioned, the recovery, right? And recovery is not just about surviving, right? It really is about being in a better state. And I would even say making sure that people are thriving. And unfortunately, we can't say no other hurricane is going to affect Jamaica or Cuba. We know this might happen again. It might even happen, we're still not out of the hurricane season, so it's about building community resilience, right? And how can we better prepare for a future disaster of this magnitude. For example, in Jamaica, part of the recovery efforts include strengthening existing community disaster response teams or creating or reactivating new ones. And why? Because the communities are obviously the first ones affected, but the first ones to respond themselves right. Making sure that communities prepare for these type of disasters and they can do things to potentially mitigate the risks. That includes things like nature-based solutions. Typically, one of the examples referenced is planting mangroves to reduce the impact of storm surge in coastal communities, or in terms of shelter and the reconstruction we don't just want people to patch up their houses, but really what we call “build back better,” that means using better material, improved construction techniques that take into account these potential disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: And on that note, how important is it for aid efforts to be incorporating the climate crisis? How important is it to be thinking about our future here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Makare’s home after a tree fell on it during Hurricane Melissa, which also wiped out all of the fruit trees in his yard. (Photo: Makare Barnes)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_home.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: Yeah, I would say it's critical. I think, you know, recovery and resilience need to be part of our just a continuous investment and not one offs. We're seeing quicker intensification of storms like Melissa and we're experiencing just more and more disasters, right? So our capacity to just operate on, just solely thinking or solely acting on just a quick relief phase is going to be stretched, and we're also seeing that the scale of needs is increasing, but the financing is not necessarily increasing that proportion. So we have to think about, how do we invest smartly? And investing smartly means making sure that we are better prepared and building that resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Marianna, before you go, amid this very difficult situation for many people in the Caribbean, what gives you hope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hurricane Melissa hit the southwest of Jamaica as a Category 5 storm with winds over 185mph. The storm, which left more than 70% of the island without power, caused extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. (Photo: Makare Barnes)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/HURRICANE_southwest.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: I think what gives me hope is seeing how quickly people are just readying themselves to support, and this comes at different levels, immediately after the passage of Melissa in both Jamaica and Cuba, the teams reached out. We reached out to them, and we were talking, for example, with Jamaican Red Cross colleagues who were under a tree trying to get connection. Their headquarters was damaged. Water was leaking in, I think there was a little bit of roof damage. And with the limited connectivity they had they were giving us a quick update of what they were seeing, telling us about the actions they were taking, running the shelters, providing psychosocial support, immediate relief distributions, but also requesting our support to mobilize our global network. And the same thing goes with Cuban Red Cross, and just outside of the affected countries, we have been receiving not just requests to understand what is happening, but also offers of support. And I think that shows the strength of our human solidarity, that it's not bound by our traditional geographic borders, and that we even in the midst of chaos and disaster and just the mammoth recovery that is ahead, people are putting all their efforts together and resources together help those who've been most affected, move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: Mariana Kuttothara is the regional head for health, disaster, climate and crisis at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. Thank you so much for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KUTTOTHARA: Thank you very much for having me, and thank you for the opportunity to highlight the work we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

It was part of the very first public prayer bringing together King Charles III, supreme governor of the Anglican Church, and Pope Leo XIV, supreme pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and it ended five centuries of separation. This act of unity by these two faith leaders who are also sovereign heads of state was embedded in their shared concern for the environment, or creation. Pope Leo offered a prayer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPE &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEO: Let us pray. God our father you have created the heavens and the earth and made us in your own image. Teach us to see your hand in all your works and your likeness in all your children. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Under the leadership of Pope Francis, Pope Leo's immediate predecessor, in 2015 the Catholic Church issued Laudato Si and later Laudate Deum, a pair of encyclicals that spiritually detailed the urgent need and morality of caring for creation. And When King Charles was the Prince of Wales, he wrote Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World. It was also a moral document steeped in spirituality with its detailed call for sustainability, action on climate change and the protection of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new unity of the Catholic and Anglican Churches brings together more than a billion people of faith under two leaders with deep understanding of our imperiled Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some insight as to how these leading Christians may make a difference for the planet, we turn now to Tony Juniper, who was a coauthor of King Charles's Harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's also a former head of Friends of the Earth UK, and now chairs Natural England, a government conservation agency. Welcome back to Living on Earth, Tony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Lovely to see you again, Steve, and nice to have a little chance to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So recently, we had Pope Leo and King Charles III praying in the Sistine Chapel together. How big a deal was this, Tony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQJ0qQVk7QU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading"&gt;A post shared by The Times and The Sunday Times (@thetimes)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: This is a hugely significant and historic moment, because this is the first time we've had such a coming together in prayer of the head of the Anglican Church and the leader of the Catholic Church since the Anglican Church was formed when Henry VIII broke away from the Roman church in 1533, and it was a time of really quite considerable upheaval across Europe in what has become known as the Reformation, with other religious movements breaking away from Rome. So this coming together of these two leaders at this point, it is very significant, because it's not happened before, and comes in the wake of some really very dramatic history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And according to the Vatican, during their meeting, Pope Leo and King Charles discussed some of their shared interests, including alleviating poverty and caring for the environment. How important were those subjects for this meeting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Well, I think very significant. I don't know what the details of the conversations or the prayer included, but evidently, this focus on ecological concerns and the protection of creation is a shared passion and really matter of spiritual identity for both of these leaders. And so that statement of common endeavor on these questions at this time, in particular, when we do have this retreat in some places, away from the ambition that we need to tackle this twin crisis of nature decline and climate change. That is very significant indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Tony, you've advised the King on the environment and climate for a long time as King, as Prince of Wales. Tell me, how has the king advocated for the earth over those years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Well, he has been a consistent, powerful, articulate champion of the natural world and people's place within it, and that needing to be a more harmonious relationship. He's been bringing this message to the world now since the early 1970s, so for more than five decades. And there are a variety of subjects that he's brought to our attention from the need to sustainable agriculture to the need to protect the tropical rainforests, to the challenges posed by climate change and all of these issues and many, many others, he has been a vocal champion of, but in relation to this meeting with the supreme leader of The Catholic Church, you know, you see a coming together, not only of those concerns which sometimes are expressed in scientific terms or which are about policy. This is a deeply spiritual matter for King Charles, and of course, is so also for the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/POPEKING_king.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Pope Francis was, of course, known for his encyclicals Laudato Si, and then Laudate Deum, advocating "Care for Our Common Home," and we've seen Pope Leo attending a Climate Justice Conference. I mean, to what extent is Pope Leo following in the footsteps of Pope Francis? And to what extent might he be willing to go even further?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: He evidently is following in the path that Pope Francis so powerfully laid out. Whether he will go further, I don't know, but under the circumstances and the extent to which we are now in the face of a gathering emergency when it comes to climate change, it may well be that he does feel as though he needs to say more and to do more in painting a picture of a really urgent situation that now needs to be taken very much more seriously than is presently the case, certainly in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So King Charles and Pope Leo are faith leaders. They're heads of state, but they're not politicians. What is the power, what is the value of them coming together on these concerns as faith leaders, beyond the immediate sphere of political action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Well, that's a really good question, Steve, and I think the power of this is absolutely enormous. And the reason I say that is because following many decades of reflection myself, I think it becomes clear that our failure thus far to deal with climate change and to deal with the extinction crises and the degradation of ecosystems, this is not something that we can put down to a lack of information or a lack of awareness. I think it is down to the extent to which these questions have been seen as scientific or technical issues, or issues that are dealt with in policy, when in fact, if you look at the roots of our difficulties at the moment in being able to rise to the challenges at hand, it's very much more about our worldview and the extent to which we have been progressively disconnected from nature and our collective philosophy has become separated from the functioning of our natural world, because that sacred nature of nature was very much there in the teachings of early Christianity, and in his book Harmony, which was published in 2010, the King speaks about the other religions, Hinduism, Taoism, Islam, and the extent to which all of these, in their early manifestations, had a very strong relationship with the sacred nature of creation, which was seen to be the work of God and thereby something which we should take care of. And so for these leaders to be thinking about the joint teachings of the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church in ways that brings creation and God's work back to center stage, I think is a really, really important part of how we begin on this journey towards a more sustainable and harmonious future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pope Leo XIV appears to be following in the footsteps of the late Pope Francis in his concern for the environment, our guest Tony Juniper says. The Pope recently attended the “Raising Hope for Climate Justice” Conference, where he reflected on the ten year anniversary of Pope Francis’ encyclical, Laudato Si’.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Here in the United States, Tony, there were many moves made on the policy level to deal with the racism here, but it was the Black church in the South that really led the movement that changed social attitudes as well as the law. This was not something which even a Supreme Court decision hadn't been able to settle in this country. So to what extent do you think having two of these most important leaders of major religions stepping out this way on the question of the environment and, as you say, care for creation, what chance does that have to make the kind of breakthrough that those Black preachers and then white preachers, by the way, were able to do on the matter of race in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Well, I think that's a really good parallel, Steve in drawing the distinction between the law and policy on the one side and a social movement on the other, which brings about change from the bottom up through people shifting their attitudes and shifting their values. And if we are going to shift the world away from its self-centered, consumerist, self-destructive path that it's on at the moment, we're going to need to foster much more of a groundswell of change. And so for leaders who are beyond politics and who bring a spiritual dimension, and who are by definition, able to take the long view, because they have their roles for life, that's a very different offering to society. And it's very interesting that Pope Leo and I know King Charles see very strong relationships between these questions of social justice and environmental themes. And indeed, the encyclical that Pope Francis released before the Paris agreement negotiations in 2015 really brought these matters of justice and ecology very close together, and Pope Leo has reinforced that message since he has become Pope. And I know that King Charles very much thinks in these terms of these linkages between human well-being and the ecological challenges that are before us, and hopefully those messages being brought out by these two leaders at the tops of these two massive global religious movements, this can begin to filter down to inform and inspire the grassroots. In many ways, they've opened the door for what I hope is a reawakening of some of the implicit values in Christianity. The ecological side perhaps will begin to be given more weight as a result of this meeting, and linked to some of those more familiar struggles about fairness and justice that have been in the church in different ways for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So COP30 is underway now in Brazil. So what kind of impact do you think this recent display of unity from these two religious leaders will have on the talks there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: It can only be positive at a time when the world is divided and there's very visible conflict and much discussion about the need for unity, these two leaders coming together on this subject at that moment is very important. And if you look back at the impact of Laudato Si and the Pope Francis encyclical that was published a couple of months before the negotiations in Paris that led to the Paris accord, one can only hope that there will be a signaling of the need for people to be working together coming from these faith leaders in a way which will have a visible impact on the negotiations. But of course, the world is in a very difficult place at the moment, with all sorts of discontinuities of consensus compared to where we were a decade ago. I do very much hope that what we will see in Brazil is a reaffirming of that consensus and world leaders departing there with every intention to redouble their efforts back home, but the momentum from the meeting of the Pope and King Charles taken forward to COP30 hopefully will see us in a space early in 2026 when we see the political ambition and the practical action really ramping up as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Tony Juniper is the Chair of Natural England, a government conservation agency, and was co-author with then the Prince of Wales in the book Harmony. Tony, thank you so much for taking the time with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: An absolute pleasure, Steve, so nice to see you again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: By the way, a documentary film titled Finding Harmony: A King’s Vision, about King Charles’ environmental legacy and spiritual philosophy, will be released in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

His longtime advisor and co-author Tony Juniper joins Host Steve Curwood to discuss His Majesty’s contributions on environment and climate, how that might influence him in his new role as King, and the passing of the activist torch to his son William, the new Prince of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[THEME]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BASCOMB: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth, I’m Bobby Bascomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING CHARLES &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III: This is a call to revolution. The Earth is under threat. It cannot cope with all that we demand of it. It is losing its balance and we humans are causing this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: That’s His Majesty King Charles III reading the opening words of his 2010 book Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World, back when he was still the Prince of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING CHARLES &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III: Revolution is a strong word and I use it deliberately. The many environmental and social problems that now loom large on our horizon cannot be solved by carrying on with the very approach that has caused them. If we want to hand on to our children and grandchildren a much more durable way of operating in the world, then we have to embark on what I can only describe as a “sustainability revolution” – and with some urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now that his majesty King Charles III has ascended to the throne, he is perhaps the most prominent environmental advocate to become head of state for a major world power. Tradition suggests the new king will not be as publicly outspoken as he was as crown prince, but now may well use his new powers to advance the causes of nature and environmental protection from behind the scenes. King Charles co-authored “Harmony” with Tony Juniper, a former head of Friends of the Earth England who for decades has advised the new sovereign on the environment and climate. Tony now chairs Natural England, a government conservation agency and joins us from London – welcome back, Tony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Lovely to see you, Steve. Nice to be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2022-09-16/JUNIPER-Charles in procession.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So, Tony, please give us a bit of the backstory on how King Charles III has made environment and climate central to his work over the years. How did he use his stature as Prince of Wales to advocate for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: It's been a remarkable contribution, looking back from the vantage point of now and the sad moment when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has passed on, and he now is King. And it's a moment to reflect on not only the future, but also the past and the incredible amount of work that King Charles did as Prince of Wales on these environmental subjects, going literally back to the late 1960s, this is a long time ago. And working with him on "Harmony," it became clear that the reasons he did this and chose this path, to use his position as Prince of Wales to champion these environmental causes, it was really because of a sense of disquiet he was feeling as he was growing up during the 1950s and 60s, when you could see the world changing very quickly. The landscape literally changing before his eyes, with the removal of woodlands and hedgerows, the drainage of wetlands, the massive use of pesticides, ancient town centers being pulled down and replaced with concrete blocks. All of these and many other things began to cause him to wonder if we were on a very wrong path. And so he decided to use his position in order to raise awareness about all of these subjects. And so as time went on, it moved beyond wildlife and pollution in this country to embrace global issues, including climate change and tropical deforestation. And so the speeches and the books have been quite famous, quite rightly. But he also set up a number of organizations, charitable organizations that sought to help do the work. He's visited countless locations across the globe, where he's met people trying to make a difference and given them encouragement. And for me, as an environmentalist growing up in the 70s, Steve, one thing that really inspired me was hearing somebody from the establishment who was prepared to speak out on these subjects, because there wasn't literally anybody else. And so I think, you know, in some ways, he really is one of the most outstanding environmental leaders the world has seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: How fair is it to say that the environment has been King Charles III, former Prince of Wales, his life's work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: I think it would be very fair to say that, Steve, recognizing that for him, environment is a very broad concept. And for him, the environment is not simply climate change. It's a whole range of different questions that come together in some pretty fundamental places, including around these ideas of harmony, which is what he expressed in that book that he published back in 2010, that I was lucky enough to help him with alongside Ian Skelly. And that work, I think, is a great example of the different ways in which he draws connections between all of these things, public health, the food supply, how we educate young people, the very way in which we conduct economics. All of these things, he would say, are environmental questions, and he's sought to explain them as environmental subjects as time has gone on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: What was the eye opening set of experiences for him that drew him to the broad concept of the environment? For many of us, of course, it's time outside in wild or certainly natural places. But to what extent do you know about what really inspired him to begin in this direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: I think one thing that inspires a lot of environmental advocates, and certainly me, and I know to an extent him also, is a love of nature. And that love of nature comes with familiarity of the natural world. And one time on a visit to his house in Scotland, very close to Balmoral, we went for a walk by a river where he used to be taken by his grandmother, the Queen Mother, and they used to fetch water from the river in the tea pot and take it indoors, boil it on an open fire to make tea. And that connection with the natural world at an early age and in that way, which was very much linked to family and linked to great times and having moments with his grandmother, this evidently left an impression on him in terms of the importance of natural areas and the outdoors to him. And again, like many other environmentalists, once you start to develop your love of nature, then you develop this shock and horror when you see the destruction of nature. And Rachel Carson, another great environmental leader from the United States, in her case, made similar points about how an ecological awareness leads to quite painful experiences when you see what is going on. And I think that's what happened for him. Having developed this love of the beauty and the wonders of the natural world, before your very eyes, you see it being destroyed by people who apparently don't care. But basically what's going on is that they don't know. And if they don't know, what can you do? Well, you have to help them understand the consequences. And so I think it was that series of steps: of love, horror, and passion to do something about it that basically took him to where he was for so many years as Prince of Wales as this very passionate, very hardworking, very determined environmentalist. And he leaves an incredible legacy, with 50 years of that under his belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So now, in 2022, the Prince of Wales, Charles the Prince of Wales becomes King Charles III. What can he do now to follow his concerns about the environment as the sovereign now of the UK, which, at least in my lifetime, has been fairly apolitical in public stance; certainly, Queen Elizabeth II was publicly very apolitical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: The role of sovereign is different to the role of Prince of Wales. And nobody knows that more than the new King Charles III. And he has been on the record over recent times, including as recently as last week, when he came to the throne, to reinforce the idea that he knows he's now going to need to do things differently in the new role that he now occupies. But irrespective of that, I think the very fact of him having spent so long and so successfully driving forward this agenda, that it actually in some ways, it doesn't really matter whether now he is constrained. Because the role of, of sovereign, of Monarch, it's something which is about what it stands for, as much as what the holder of the role does, if that makes sense. So the very fact of him having been such a prominent environmentalist for so long, I think automatically means now that with him as the holder of that role, the embodiment of that role, then automatically, almost, it has to have an ecological dimension to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="King Charles III, who was at the time Prince of Wales, plants a tree with Indian President Ram Nath Kovind in 2019. (Photo: Government of India, public domain)" src="https://loe.org/content/2022-09-16/JUNIPER-planting a tree.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: As I understand it, traditionally, once a week or so the prime minister meets with the monarch. Those are private meetings, as far as I know, never really disclosed to the public. To what extent do you think that King Charles III might take that opportunity to have comments about environment and conservation to the Prime Minister?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: I have no idea, Steve; nobody will know because those meetings are strictly confidential, and nothing ever leaks out either from the prime minister or the palace. And so that remains a conversation between the head of state and the head of government, and the rest of us won't necessarily know the details. But you know, if one is speculating about the role of monarch and the interests of the monarch, and the extent to which one of the things they are there to do is to warn of danger and to take the long view, then the subjects that he has been so passionately engaged with certainly will be in both of those categories: of danger factors for the realm and the planet, and very much about the long term interests of society, not just the coming weeks or the coming months or even the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: So now that the new Prince of Wales, Prince William, takes over, to what extent do you think he was tutored by his father in the environment? He has, of course, this challenge fund that he's already put out; he's made some speeches along these lines. What do you think will be his level of enthusiasm to address the environment and conservation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Like his father, Prince William, who now is taking on the role of Prince of Wales, has expressed quite a lot of interest in quite a range of issues: mental health, the well being of veterans, and of course, the environmental issues. And the environmental piece is coming out more strongly as time has gone on, with the Earthshot Prize being the most recent example of that. But if you look back over the recent history of all of this, you know, it's worth remembering that the Duke of Edinburgh, so King Charles's father, was also a passionate environmentalist and worked as the international president for WWF for some time, and was involved with the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust here, which is now a more global organization working on wildlife and wetlands. He was very involved with all of those things. Actually, there was a remarkable moment here a few years ago when we had all three generations, the Duke of Edinburgh, the then-Prince of Wales, and then-Prince William coming together to launch an initiative called United for Wildlife, which was about cracking down on the illegal wildlife trade, so tiger parts and elephant ivory and some of these despicable activities that continue. The three of them came together to try and kickstart some more determined action to do something about that, which was a lovely thing to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Fascinating. Tony, how much support is there currently now among the public in the UK for acting on nature and climate issues, and really the crisis around the climate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tony Juniper has been a longtime advisor to King Charles III on environment and climate matters and co-authored two books with him on the subjects. He’s currently Chair of Natural England and former head of Friends of the Earth UK. (Photo: Jason Bye, courtesy of Tony Juniper)" src="https://loe.org/content/2022-09-16/JUNIPER-Tony_Juniper.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Yeah, the appetite for action in this country dramatically transformed over the last few years. And we've had a whole raft of new policies and initiatives come from government, which reflect that very deep shift in the public mood on all of this. And, you know, Boris Johnson's government were very energetic in bringing forward new agricultural policies, new targets for curbing biodiversity loss, doing more on the net zero agenda. And I'm very much hoping that the new government will stick in that similar vein. Because like many other countries, we have a short term cost of living crisis, hopefully a short term cost of living crisis, which has diverted attention. But of course, trying to resolve that cost of living crisis through rolling back environmental action, it's a false narrative. It won't work. And also, of course, just leaves these things to get bigger for later. I think a lot of people are beginning to see that actually, the same things that we need to do for climate change are the same things we need to do to manage rising prices, recognizing now that the cheapest energy that we can get in this country is renewables. And so the idea that we can deal with the crisis by pumping more gas, it's just plain wrong, because these big questions are not going away. They're becoming very real now, in terms of the consequences that we see for people and in this country we've had an historical unprecedented drought period, which has caused big impacts on the water supply, on food production. And at the same time, we're looking at what's going on in Pakistan with the terrible effects for people there, with rocks the size of small cars coming down mountainsides in unprecedented monsoon rains. We're living in "the era of consequences," as Winston Churchill would have called it. And I think if we're going to have leaders fit for the world that we now live in, they've got to keep this front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Tony Juniper is chair of Natural England and longtime adviser to King Charles III, with whom he's co-authored two books on the environment. Tony, thanks so much for taking the time with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUNIPER: Steve, it was an absolute pleasure to share a few thoughts at this historic moment. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Longtime COP observer Jennifer Morgan is a former executive director of Greenpeace and former state secretary and special climate envoy for Germany who is now a senior fellow at Tufts University. She joins Host Steve Curwood to preview COP30 and discuss the focus on closing the gap between current greenhouse gas reduction policies and what’s needed to limit warming to a safer level.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOERING: From PRX and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston, this is Living on Earth. I’m Jenni Doering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And I’m Steve Curwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest climate negotiations of the year are kicking off, with world leaders and climate experts from more than 190 countries coming to Belem in the Brazilian Amazon. COP30 is this year's conference of the parties to the UN Climate Treaty. And this gathering comes as the momentum of climate disruption grows with massive heat waves, wildfires, severe storms, floods, rising sea levels and melting polar regions. Joining us now is Jennifer Morgan, a former Executive Director of Greenpeace, and former State Secretary and Special Climate Envoy for Germany. She's now a Senior Fellow at Tufts University. Jennifer, COP 30 marks thirty years of these talks. How is this year's session? Is it both a moment of reflection of past work and a turning point of future progress, do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: I think it's both, I think the reflection is occurring as we speak, reports are coming out about, what is the difference from 10 years ago, whether it be in temperature rise that has been lowered, you know, the world was on track for a 7.2 degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature 10 years ago. Now, the UNEP report has just come out and said it's more like a four degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature. So there's been a decline, which is good, but not enough, of course. And I've heard a lot of people discussing what's been happening in the energy sector. I think 10 years on, things have happened that I certainly couldn't have imagined in Paris. You know, we are seeing solar capacity being deployed annually at 15 times what was predicted in 2015, we're seeing EVs, then it was one in 100 being sold. Now it's one in five cars being sold are electric vehicles. So I think it's important to reflect on that, but then to say, okay, how do we accelerate? We've got this positive foundation, countries are coming forward with their national plans, the institutions are working, but we're far off course of where we need to be. And I think that is the key topic at this COP is, how do we accelerate action? How do we close that gap where we know we need countries to be doing more, the private sector to be doing more in a way that drives economic prosperity and resilience and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Who are the key players at this year's Conference of the Parties, at this COP? Which countries or leaders should the public be watching here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/COP30_brazil.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Well, obviously Brazil. Brazil is the president of this COP, President Lula has been very engaged, and they are hosting this meeting in the Amazon. And Brazil has a very strong history of diplomatic successes. So I think how they pull this all together is absolutely fundamental, so watching what they are doing as a major emerging economy is key. China, also world's largest emitting country, also massive growth in green products moving forward, what role will they play? Will they step into the U.S.'s footsteps at all in perhaps more leadership with Chinese characteristics, what does that look like? The European Union working to integrate climate and decarbonization to become the world's first decarbonized, carbon neutral continent, they traditionally have played a leadership role working with developing countries. So it's always important to listen to what the small islands are saying, the least developed countries, we know they are on the front line, and so listening to the alliance of small island states, that's normally where I start. But then these other players need to come along, obviously as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And by the way, Brazil is also now a major producer of oil, as well as having a big piece of the Amazon. How do those contradictions affect the country's leadership in this year's COP, do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Despite its strong commitments to climate and rainforest protection, Brazil is aiming to become a large producer of offshore oil and even began oil drilling near the Amazon River for the first time a few weeks ago, just before the UN conference. Above, the first 100% Brazilian oil platform, the P-51, in January 2009. (Photo: Divulgação Petrobras, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0 BR)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/COP30_oil.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Well, it's clear Brazil is struggling with the transition, as I would say, all countries are finding their way. On the one hand, numbers just came out that showed that 2023 there was a decrease of 11.6% of deforestation happening compared to the year before. This is a very positive development. But Brazil is also looking to explore oil and gas and those resources, and I think it needs, therefore, to be actually leaning more into its clean energy possibilities, which it has. And that's where this COP is so important, that oil and gas producing countries like Norway, like Canada, like Australia, like Brazil, that they all come together and say, we really mean it, that we're going to transition away from fossil fuels in a just way. And this is our roadmap for how we're going to get there, even if we know right now we're not going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now, the Paris Agreement required each participating country to make nationally determined contributions, NDCs, to reduce national emissions and curb climate disruption. What do you expect will change regarding these commitments in this year's COP? What commitments are being made? What commitments are you waiting on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Another big theme at COP30 is supporting countries in moving towards a just energy transition. Jennifer Morgan says India is stepping up as a leader in this sector by meeting 50% of the country’s energy demands with renewables over the summer. Above, a solar thermal power plant in Rajasthan, India. (Photo: Bkwcreator, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/COP30_justtransition.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Well, at this year's COP, every country was committed as part of the Paris Agreement to put forward every five years an updated, nationally determined contribution. Many of those have come in, I would expect that they're still coming in. You know, we are still waiting for a few but I think all eyes have been on China and its NDC, as they're called, because they are the largest emitter, where they've put forward, certainly a very stable NDC and economy wide, with all the greenhouse gasses, which is new and big, and saying they're, for the first time, committing to absolutely reduce their emissions, but the ambition is less than what actually most analysts say they're going to achieve. So it's an under, lowballing, I guess you would say, of its commitment. Where does India come in? We've seen recently, renewables has met over 50% of total electricity demands in July, on a day this year. They're moving in that direction, its own transition. Will they be ready to step forward? And then, of course, Saudi Arabia will be also interesting to watch. I just mention them because, on the one hand, what I observe is Saudi Arabia is diversifying its national economy and moving into solar. They are investing massively in solar domestically and also in Africa, but clearly has a big interest to continue to export its oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: And by the way, the United States is not participating in this Conference of the Parties, it seems. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Formally, it means that in the Paris Agreement, there will be no one sitting behind the US flag. You know, you sit at a table. Everybody has their names of their countries ahead of them and speaks so there'll be no US voice negotiating around these different decisions that need to be moved forward at this COP, I think it's a great loss for the United States not to have a voice in negotiating not only the future of our stable climate, but also the framework for future markets and current markets, but it means that other countries will be making these decisions. And obviously there will be other voices there. I think that there are voices coming from governors and representatives and business certainly, but the federal government will be absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The United States, the largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, will not have a federal representative at this year’s conference. Above, former President Biden pledged the U.S.’s commitment to climate at COP27 in Egypt.

&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: On a top line basis, what are the things that need to be decided at this Conference of the Parties, at COP30?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: So it's a different kind of a COP, because there's not some big bang thing that's going to happen at five in the morning on the last day, but rather, there's a series of signals, decisions, and I would call them proof points, to demonstrate that they're accelerating action. So first of all, I think a very important decision is on adaptation, on how to build more resilient infrastructure, houses, food systems, to the impacts that are already happening. That, there's indicators, which is a very practical way of trying to see, okay, what needs to happen by when. And then, how is that going to be financed? More funding for that adaptation for the most vulnerable countries, that's a very important, for example, outcome for Africa. There will be a discussion on forests, of course, being in the Amazon, and there, I would say, signals of meeting that goal and accelerating around zero deforestation by 2030 that was set two years ago. But also, Brazil has put forward a Tropical Forest Forever Fund, a new financing mechanism for standing forests to avoid deforestation in the future. So which countries might sign up to that? How will that get financed? And then third, I would put forward the energy issue. Two years ago, countries decided to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly, equitable fashion and triple renewables. They're not on track for that. There is a lot of progress on renewables. It still hasn't been tripled. So there are discussions, maybe there should be a roadmap of how to actually do that transition, where you have the different pathways being discussed, and then looking at what are the initiatives around grids, around storage that really can help overcome barriers so that that transition to renewables can accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: In the news, it's been Hurricane Melissa here in the Western Hemisphere, really shredding places like Jamaica and Cuba. And these smaller island states are very concerned about the climate crisis. What might we hear in terms of discussions about loss and damage in countries in the tropics, in the Global South, or how reparations might be made at this point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="In the wake of Hurricane Melissa, it’s clear that small island nations suffer the brunt of climate woes. One way these nations are planning to raise funds for climate reparations is through a levy on premium flight tickets and private jets. (Photo: Katsuhiko Tokunaga, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.0)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/COP30_hurricane.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Well, loss and damage is something that small island nations fought for a fund for 30 years that was established a few years ago, and now it's really about providing funds for that loss and damage, response to loss and damage fund. So I would expect to hear pressure for pledges for that but also some new approaches. So, there is a group of countries that's going to be coming forward. They've already stated their intent on this, like France and Spain and Kenya and some small island nations, to put a solidarity levy on premium tickets, so first class, business class flights and private jets, and that group has said, we need a new, innovative way of funding loss and damage, also adaptation, because we know that public budgets are tight, and we also know that the numbers around these damages are just absolutely huge. So I would look out for that coalition, premium flyers group that's coming forward, and also other ideas on how actually to raise the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Now, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change operates under consensus, meaning that all participating parties must agree on terms before they can be applied. So to what extent does this rule of consensus make it difficult to reach climate goals, and what changes, if any, are being discussed along those lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jennifer Morgan is an American-German environmental activist specializing in climate change policy. From 2022 to 2025, she was the special representative for international climate policy of the Federal Foreign Office in Germany. From 2016 to 2022, Morgan co-led Greenpeace International. (Photo: Photothek)" src="https://loe.org/content/2025-11-07/COP30_morgan.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Well, certainly having to have consensus of all countries together, on the one hand, is a good thing, because everybody has had to agree, but clearly it also enables those that want to move more slowly, to slow things down, whether it's on emission reductions or whether it's on finance. And I think that has made it more difficult, and this year, and I think moving into the future, there is a new discussion about reform of the process, with different ideas coming forward. And one that certainly has been raised by scientists and by even some countries, has been to revise what's called the rules of procedure, the voting rules at the climate meeting. I doubt that will be possible this year, that would be a multi-year effort. But I think it's important to be looking at how to make the UN Framework Convention more efficient. We need these multilateral approaches more than ever, and so finding ways of increasing their effectiveness is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: You've been going to these Conferences of the Parties, I guess it's COP30, you've been to 30 of them. How do you feel this year about this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: I feel determined and worried, worried about the pace of change that's not fast enough, and determined to work with the thousands who will be there to accelerate that pace of change and not let one country that's trying to slow it down hold the rest of the world back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CURWOOD: Jennifer Morgan is a climate activist, a former German diplomat on the climate, and former Executive Director of Greenpeace. Thank you so much for taking the time with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORGAN: Great to be with you.&lt;/p&gt;

Turn on your flashlight and grab the covers, because I’m going to tell you a horror story about one of the deadliest killers in American history – and it’s not who you think it is.  
  
It’s 1961, and our killer is on the loose. It haunts cities like Tacoma, Washington and El Paso, Texas. But really it’s everywhere. It infiltrates your every breath, bubbles in your bathwater, and seeps into your brain. And it goes largely unnoticed. Until strange things start happening. 
  
You start to get headaches and nausea. The children in your neighborhood fall behind in school, experience developmental delays and behavioral problems. There’s a sharp rise in violence and crime. The news fills with stories of kidnappings and murders. You’re told to lock your doors, to stay inside after dark. But it doesn’t matter. Our killer can’t be stopped by a curfew. 
  
It’s in the air – pumped out by huge, towering smelters and every car that drives by. The smell is awful, but they tell you it’s normal. The smokestacks symbolize industry, growth, and pride. The smelter becomes one of the landmarks of your beloved city. Our killer is celebrated throughout the country. 
  
Have you guessed it yet? 
  
Lead. 
  
A powerful neurotoxin, known today to cause kidney damage, infertility, and increased aggression and impulsivity in those exposed. At higher levels, lead poisoning can be fatal. For decades, lead poured into the environment from smelters, paint, pipes, and every gallon of leaded gasoline burned. The fallout poisoned our water and air, and warped young minds, potentially even helping to shape the violent impulses of future serial killers. 
  
This is a story that Caroline Fraser, one of our guests this week, knows all too well. Her newest book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20556/9780593657225"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, links high lead exposure in children in the 1950s and 60s to the sharp rise in serial killers in the 70s and 80s, including infamous murderers like Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway, and Richard Ramirez. Fraser documents how companies, such as the American Smelting and Refining Company, also known as Asarco, poisoned our world while selling us a dream of progress wrapped in smoke and profit. She reminds us that the deadliest killers are often unseen, unheard, and unchallenged.  
  
The end of this American horror story is only half-written. Asarco’s Tacoma smelter closed its doors in 1985; leaded gasoline was banned in 1996. But our killer lingers. 
  
Today, lead hides in old paint, in aging pipes, in soil near old smelter sites, and in the blood of millions of Americans. While lead doesn’t pose nearly as much of a threat now as it did 50 years ago, its legacy reminds us of the damage previous generations and our environment have endured, and warns of future ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you &lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00044&amp;amp;segmentID=3"&gt;listen to our conversation with Caroline Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, remember: this horror story only ends when we decide it will.  &lt;strong&gt;Bella Smith&lt;/strong&gt;

The Day of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos in Spanish, is a holiday celebrated throughout Mexico and other parts of the Americas. 
  
There’s debate on the origin of the practice, but to my understanding it’s a blend of indigenous mesoamerican traditions and Catholic observances brought to the Americas by Spanish colonizers.  
  
It's a national holiday in Mexico where families and friends gather to honor their deceased loved ones. The idea is that no one who isn’t forgotten is actually dead and that by setting up a colorful altar we’ll attract and welcome the spirits of the departed back home.

This year, Dia de los Muertos is especially significant for my family since my Father recently passed away. I’ve had the restless urge to make sure he can enjoy all of the elements and tributes an altar of this kind has to offer.  
  
The concept of the holiday itself can be seen as a contradiction to traditional Christian and Catholic practices. After all, believing that objects can attract the dead back to earth does not fall in line with the purist Christian ideology. Although, many altars include general Christian imagery (like the cross) and more specific Roman Catholic religious symbols — like the image of a saint the deceased was devoted to, or whose feast day falls on the deceased’s birthday. Still, to my knowledge, you don’t have to be Christian, Roman Catholic, or belong to a specific religion to set up an altar.  
  
Let me preface this note by clarifying that I’m no expert in Day of the Dead altars, but here’s a bit of what I’ve learned through the years and this planning process.  
  
Traditional altars are colorful, maximalist, and full of life! 
  
Altars can have 2 levels representing heaven and earth, 3 levels representing heaven purgatory and earth, or the more elaborate 7 levels representing different steps to heaven. The seven layers may also represent the different stages to reach Mictlan, the underworld of Mexica mythology.  
  
Like a lot of families throughout Mexico, we usually celebrate Dia de los Muertos by visiting a cemetery, but that won’t be possible for my partner and I this time around. So we decided to go all out and build a 7 tier altar for our loved ones. (&lt;a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/life/faith/2022/10/31/how-to-create-an-altar-for-dia-de-los-muertos/69587073007/"&gt;more on how to build different layer altars&lt;/a&gt;)

Day of the Dead altars can be dedicated to family, friends, mentors — basically anyone who’s passed away and you’d like to commemorate and celebrate.  
  
There’s even a day of the dead dedicated to pets on October 27! (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/10/25/day-of-the-dead-pets-ofrendas/"&gt;more on that here&lt;/a&gt;).  
  
It doesn’t have to be expensive or an elaborate structure. We’re going the eco-friendly route and using cardboard boxes to set up the layers.  
  
Because of how place and community shapes culture, the specifics on what to incorporate vary across regions and family traditions.  
  
Altares (or alters) represent a connection to the circle of life as well as the four elements of nature: water, wind, fire and earth. 
  
Water: Altars traditionally incorporate a glass of water to signify purity. 
  
Wind: The light and delicate texture of papel picado or perforated paper represents wind and the fragility of life. Some say the holes in the tissue paper make it possible for the souls to travel and visit us.
Papel picado is not only placed in Dia de los Muertos altars but also adorns the streets of Mexico .

Fire: Lit candles, which serve to light the path and guide the spirits of the deceased home. 
  
Earth: Seeds, fruits and food. Since we’re dedicating the altar to multiple people, we plan on cooking up a feast as well as purchasing from local shops. Tamales, bacalao, and seafood. Agua de horchata and cold beer will also be part of this tier because who wouldn’t want to be received with a cool beverage after a long journey! 
  
Copal, an aromatic incense to purify the environment.  
  
At the bottom of the altar, we’ll be placing the flor de cempasuchil petals. It's a flower native to Mexico known as the Mexican marigold. Its colorful orange and yellow petals, as well as its fragrant smells, are meant to attract and guide the departed back home.

Personal objects: 
  
To honor my father’s connection to the earth and agriculture, we’re incorporating alfalfa, cotton flowers and a bit of dirt from the fields he worked on and loved dearly.  
  
Planning an altar this year has led to long phone calls with aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. with the intention of learning more about our loved ones. It’s healing to cherish the joys that our beloved enjoyed, they’re favorite foods, what they loved about this earth and to be able to receive them.  
  
Like Elida Guardia Bonet mentioned back in 2011 during a Living Earth &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=11-P13-00051&amp;amp;segmentID=2"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the Day of the Dead, “You're celebrating the afterlife but you're also celebrating the life that you shared with those people here, on earth.” 
  
In my opinion, the Day of the Dead can be celebrated by anyone who’s moved to do so as long as it’s done respectfully. &lt;/p&gt;

On Sept. 21, people celebrated the first public swim in the Chicago River in nearly 100 years. 
  
The sight of hundreds of swimmers jumping into the waterway that runs through the heart of downtown Chicago marked the culmination of more than four decades of collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies and environmental groups, including the nonprofit Friends of the Chicago River. 
  
Friends of the Chicago River was founded in 1979, not long after cofounder Robert Cassidy published the essay “The Friendless River,” where he decried the decades of abuse and neglect that had transformed the Chicago River from a great natural resource into an open sewer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Chicago River is the city's most neglected natural resource,” Cassidy wrote. “It is overshadowed by Lake Michigan, disdained by environmentalists and outdoorsmen alike, neglected, fouled, and abused by industry and by all the rest of us. Nonetheless, it is the second greatest gift that nature has bestowed on this city.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River, joins &lt;em&gt;Living on Earth&lt;/em&gt; in this week’s show to share the inspiring story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she tells it, the 156-mile Chicago River has amazing history wrapped up in engineering marvel. The river once flowed east into Lake Michigan, the source of drinking water for Chicago and surrounding areas. However, the river was always treated like a stepchild. It had long been the receptacle of the area’s untreated sewage and stormwater runoff.  In 1900, to protect the quality of Lake Michigan, engineers reversed the Chicago River. It now flows into the west from Lake Michigan to the Des Plaines River, before it joins the Mississippi River system, which meanders south before it empties into the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, with the growth of the city, sewage plagued the river. Spills occurred regularly. In response, during the 1970s, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) came up with the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP), one of the most ambitious and expensive public works projects in the region’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Deep Tunnel, TARP is a system of deep, large diameter tunnels and vast reservoirs designed to reduce flooding, improve water quality in Chicago area waterways, and protect Lake Michigan from pollution caused by sewer overflows, especially during periods of heavy rainfall, according to MWRD. Construction began in 1975 and is still underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the project is complete, likely in 2032, TARP will be able to hold 17.5 billion gallons. That is more than 4,666 gallons for each person in its service area, MWRD boasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first portions of the system became operational in 1981, TARP has captured over a trillion gallons of combined sewage, according to MWRD. That’s contaminated water that could have ended up in the Chicago River. 
  
The cleaner Chicago River is not just a triumph of science and engineering. Frisbie said it’s also a major cultural milestone. Longtime area residents found it hard to imagine the river as a place to swim. They saw the river as a place to dump sewage – except on St. Patrick’s Day, when it’s dyed green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the billion-dollar infrastructure projects, the river has benefitted from green infrastructure initiatives like swamp and marsh reclamation, restoring habitats for native species, and building walking trails. It’s crucial to build resilience in the face of climate change, Frisbie warns us. Given the warming of the planet, extreme rainfall events will tax TARP’s capacity. 
  
Still, Frisbie believes other cities with polluted urban waterways can learn from Chicago. The story of the Chicago River’s restoration is one of collaboration, persistence and not taking no for an answer, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restored health of the Chicago River gives us reason to hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Sophie, and I recently joined Living on Earth as an editorial intern. As Living on Earth joins the world in mourning the loss of primatologist, conservationist, and humanitarian Dr. Jane Goodall, I wanted to share how her recent passing has compelled me to reflect on a chapter of my own life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I remember learning of Dr. Goodall’s experiences living among chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania, during which she observed apes displaying behaviors previously thought to be uniquely human. After her breakthrough discovery in 1960 – that chimps create and use tools – she continued to document similarities between chimpanzees and humankind. Through her fieldwork, Goodall observed that, like us, chimpanzees are sentient, intelligent, social beings who show compassion and experience emotions like joy and grief. By immersing herself fully in their world, she taught us that we are not alone in our ability to form strong family bonds and friendships, nor in our tendency to wage war against our enemies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve witnessed primates display many of these behaviors firsthand. Before I got my start in journalism, a combination of my educational background and lifelong love of animals landed me in behavioral research laboratories where I spent several years working very closely with monkeys. I saw that monkeys can learn to complete complex tasks, discriminate between their favorite foods, and even maim one another in a bloody competition to win the title of alpha female. The context for my work was utterly different, and yet, I thought of Jane Goodall often. She was there between the high-pitched shrieks of excitement from a baby marmoset learning to pick up a live mealworm for the first time. I thought of her work as I watched a cotton-top tamarin monkey bring fruit to an aging female too weak to gather her own and, later, as he called out for her, repeatedly, in sadness and confusion after the older monkey’s death.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young women trailblazing the male-dominated field of primatology research, Jane Goodall had to fight back hard against those who told her that scientists must be coldly objective. She argued that not only was it possible to be both scientifically accurate and empathetic to the animals she studied, but that it was, in fact, a strength. My own deep empathy for animals, which had drawn me to work with them initially, positioned me to advocate for their improved well-being, always pushing for measures that would increase their joy and minimize their pain. That same empathy was also why I declined to continue working with the lab as it transitioned to more invasive research procedures. I left the field in search of something more aligned with my belief that all living beings deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, a value no doubt informed by Goodall’s revelations and perseverance.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jane Goodall’s legacy stretches far beyond her ground-breaking scientific findings. Perhaps her greatest contributions to the world can be found in her conservation and humanitarian efforts. The last time Jane Goodall was interviewed on Living on Earth in 2023, she told us that she started her youth conservation program back in 1991, Roots and Shoots, because many young people were losing hope about our world, angered by older generations compromising their future and feeling hopeless and apathetic. “Well, we have compromised their future,” she begins, “in fact we’ve been stealing it, we still are.” But she showed them that hope was not yet lost. “There’s a window of time, if we get together, we can start to heal some of the scars we’ve inflicted on poor old planet Earth, slow down climate change, slow down loss of biodiversity.” For nearly 35 years, Jane Goodall shared this message with millions of people around the world, galvanizing the youth conservation movement then and now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear that this window is shrinking. Though we will miss the kindness and humanity she showed as a leader in this movement, this isn’t a time for slowing down our efforts. There is still so much work to be done. For me, to celebrate Jane Goodall is not only to reflect on her remarkable past but to challenge ourselves to create a more sustainable future for our planet, one that honors her lifelong commitment to the dignity of all living beings and actualizes her harmonious vision for our natural world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Goodall once said that “Every single one of us makes a difference every day – it is up to us as to the kind of difference we make.” I strive to live by these words and honor her legacy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deep gratitude, 
&lt;strong&gt;Sophie Bokor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Meet Jade!</title><link href="/meet-jade.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-09-29:/meet-jade.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-09-29&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meet Jade Hello, LOE listeners! 
  
My name is Jade, and I'm one of LOE's interns this fall! I’m big into storytelling and care deeply about our environment. So of course, getting the chance to immerse myself in the inner workings of a nonprofit organization focused on sharing environmental news through audio storytelling was an opportunity I couldn’t say no to. 
  
A little bit about me: I'm a recent graduate from Bryn Mawr College, right outside Philadelphia, where I majored in creative writing and minored in psychology and gender/sexuality studies. As a liberal arts gal, I chose writing as my medium of choice because the topics to explore are endless. I’m often found roaming the interdisciplinary forests hoping to find hidden connections.  In this next season of my career journey, I’m moving into the world of environmental exploration, whether it pertains to science, politics, or culture. Of course, our environment and our social experiences heavily overlap — those are the stories I can’t wait to unearth! There’s a ton of captivating research out there, but sometimes it’s hard to decipher what it really means in the context of our everyday lives. That’s where things get fun — by intertwining scientific voices with the language of everyday life, we create digestible, captivating stories that both inform and intrigue. 
  
Although I thought prose and poetry were the only forms of writing I’d encountered during my undergrad, I ended up taking a course on writing for radio and podcasts in which a new love for media writing, production, and investigation bloomed. My professor brought in a bunch of media experts, and I finally saw what a career in the writing world could manifest into — yes, I could still delve into literature through an academic lens and write short stories, but I didn’t need to make it my career. The question “what should I pursue after college?” had less hazy answers after taking the media writing course. I finally could see myself outside of college, working in public radio, and helping produce a plethora of stories. 
  
One of my favorite aspects of the production process is pulling together tape from interviews and transforming it into something digestible, informative, and engaging. I’ve always considered myself to be very visual — so why does audio have such a sparkle in my view? Well, despite the fact that your eyes can be closed while consuming a podcast, it’s indeed a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; visual format! Like a book, you have the pleasure of creating your own imagery which makes listening that much more personal. 
  
I’m so excited to continue my storytelling journey with LOE this fall! LOE’s program is built to allow us interns to really sink our teeth into the full production process, and I look forward to what’s to come. 
  
Cheers! &lt;/p&gt;

During those two days, speakers from around the country came to share their community stories and urge attendees to not only practice hope, but also to engage in the work necessary to make sure all communities have a voice to assure access to clean water, air, and land.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key quotes from the conference that highlight this message: 
  
“Our environmental and climate justice movement was not birthed in government. It was not funded by federal dollars. It was birthed out of struggle. And it will continue to progress and move forward. We don’t have a reverse on this bus!” ~ Dr. Robert Bullard, the Father of Environmental Justice 
  
“I think part of it is if we can remove the article ‘the’ before we say environment… For communities that I’ve worked with, it’s very intimate… so they call it ‘my air,’ ‘my water,’ ‘my land.’” ~Monique Harden, Former Director of Law and Policy and the Community Engagement Program Manager at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice 
  
“Instead of playing defence and thinking about how we’re going to not lose more, we ought to be just really boldly looking at what kind of world we want.” ~  Dr. Meghan Kallman, RI State Senator and Associate Professor at UMass Boston’s School for Global Inclusion &amp;amp; Social Development 
  
“Fear is temporary, but regret is forever. So my question to you all is: Are you going to stand up and demand climate action and environmental justice for our generation and the next and those to follow? Or are you going to wait until it’s your life on the line?” ~ Nalleli Cobo, Activist and Storyteller, Peace is Loud, Los Angeles, CA 
  
“We must continue to transform fear into hope, oppression into liberation, injustice into justice, and hatred into love.” ~ Rev. Benjamin Chavis, President and CEO of the National Newspaper

Perseverance at the Public Media Conference You might have heard that public media is going through a hard time. (Perhaps the understatement of the century.) Congress rolled back $1.1 billion of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) this July. Shortly after, CPB, which brought us everything from &lt;em&gt;Arthur&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Nova&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5489808/cpb-shut-down-public-broadcasting-trump"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be shutting down. Federal funding for public media is no more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station managers are having to &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/08/south-dakota-public-broadcasting-to-reduce-workforce-by-25/"&gt;lay off colleagues&lt;/a&gt; and cut programming. They’re &lt;a href="https://kuac.org/faq-kuac-broadcasting-changes/"&gt;turning off transmitters overnight&lt;/a&gt;. And some stations, like &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/09/university-to-begin-wind-down-of-wpsu-after-acquisition-vote-fails/"&gt;WPSU in Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be headed for outright closure. In rural areas, public radio is often the primary and sometimes the only source of local journalism. If these stations disappear, who will keep residents informed about the news that impacts their lives? How will voters understand vital issues at play in elections? Our already-fragile democracy may not survive the disappearance of public media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I headed to this year’s big public radio conference in Salt Lake City in August, a part of me wondered if the mood would be muted, even grim. Something akin to an emergency room where all heroic life-saving efforts had failed. I worried my energy and enthusiasm for this beleaguered field would be sapped. I imagined having to steel myself to find the will to keep producing content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my relief and delight, I found the complete opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who make public radio possible are hardly throwing in the towel. Instead, they’re eager to innovate, experiment with new ways of reaching audiences, and deepen connections with local listeners. They’re determined to make lemonade out of this very sour situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/08/ira-glass-to-pubmedia-the-time-of-invention-does-not-need-to-be-over/"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, Ira Glass of &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; reminded us that despite the funding cuts, it’s an “enormously energizing moment to be on the radio and doing journalism” at a time when “this country is wrenching itself through such seismic changes. To be able to witness that and to capture it and to have the privilege to go out with microphones and people will talk to you about it … I just feel, like, what could be more interesting?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, these producers and program directors are just a wonderfully warm, genuine bunch. This was my first time attending the content conference run by PMCC, the Public Media Content Collective. I finally had the chance to meet program directors from the stations that air &lt;em&gt;Living on Earth&lt;/em&gt; – Jonathan Blakley of WYPR in Baltimore, Cheryl Snyder of KTOO in Alaska, Tristan Clum of KUNM in Albuquerque, and Michael Marsolek of Montana Public Radio to name a few. It felt like a family reunion — without any of the drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, public radio creators love to entertain as well as inform, and the conference featured among other things an energetic live taping at a local brewery of the history and pop culture gameshow “&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/1255528265/who-what-when"&gt;Who What When&lt;/a&gt;,” from South Carolina Public Radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off with some wild joy and delight, BirdNote® partnered with a &lt;a href="https://www.longwingbirds.com/"&gt;local bird expert&lt;/a&gt; to bring in magnificent Eurasian eagle owls, who swooped down the hotel ballroom… and a cockatoo named Gidget who moonlights as a hairstylist!     
   
Much of the fighting spirit among everyone at the conference comes from you, the listeners who &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/07/donors-stepping-up-to-bolster-stations-after-cpb-funding-cuts/"&gt;showed up spectacularly&lt;/a&gt; during recent emergency pledge drives. You all are why we keep making the best radio we can. We yak on the air about this a lot, I know, but you are essential to keeping public radio alive. By pitching in with your hard-earned dollars, but also, and more importantly, by being a part of this community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I don’t want to minimize the difficult months ahead for our public radio colleagues across the country. Even the groundswell of listener support, and the &lt;a href="https://publicmedia.co/bridge-fund/"&gt;Public Media Bridge Fund&lt;/a&gt; effort from major philanthropies, are not enough to make up the lost funding. Public media creators will need to channel all the strength and resolve we can to get through the coming months. With the stakes so high — democracy itself is on the line — we must. And we will!  &lt;strong&gt;Jenni Doering&lt;/strong&gt;

Not because I was good at it — it was only thanks to hours of tutoring that I scraped by with a B. Not because I liked my teacher — she was so queerphobic that she wouldn't allow her children to interact with me during Take Your Child to Work Day. But because it taught me that the world was made of chemicals. Before grasping the basics of chemistry, the air was just air. Water was water. The books on my shelves were mere paper. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6wpNhyreDE"&gt;Cookies were flour, sugar, and butter.&lt;/a&gt; Stuff was what it was.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning chemistry flips this worldview on its head. Though we tend to think of "chemicals" as mysterious substances that could potentially poison us, all matter is made from chemicals. Your thoughts are a series of chemical reactions. Your pants are held together with chemical bonds. The air you breathe is all chemicals, including the oxygen you need to survive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding this opens up a world of creativity to scientists trying to tackle the plastic waste problem. &lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00036&amp;amp;segmentID=3"&gt;This week on the show&lt;/a&gt;, we hear from Dr. Stephen Wallace whose team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01845-5"&gt;figured out how to alter &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to produce a series of enzymes that turn a key component of plastic waste into acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. Acetaminophen, like over half of our pharmaceuticals, is derived from fossil fuels. This means that the production of pharmaceuticals not only contributes to the climate crisis, but that if we're not careful, humanity could run out of the fossil fuels needed to make life saving medications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dr. Wallace's mind, though, fossil fuels are mostly carbon. And so is most waste. Since &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=18-P13-00007&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt;, like the vast majority of living things, love carbon, he sees potential in every empty plastic bottle. His research focuses on how we can harness microorganisms to turn our waste into something new. In addition to his work turning plastic bottles into acetaminophen, he's also contributed to research that aims to convert &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/12/550465000/behold-the-fatberg-london-s-130-ton-rock-solid-sewer-blockage"&gt;sewer waste&lt;/a&gt; into perfume. That's right. Sewer waste into perfume. Perfume is made from carbon. And sewer waste is mostly carbon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of science as something that makes the world less wondrous. Concrete, rational explanations are boring, after all. But once you get down into the nitty gritty details about how reality works, even the pen sitting on your &lt;a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2012/10/visual-history-school-desks"&gt;desk&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. And when we harness this wonder, we can use it to make the world a better place. One carbon molecule at a time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00032&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Air Pollution and Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
Thousands of people across the United States live near industrial facilities and petrochemical plants that expose them to higher levels of air pollution, but chemical exposure risk is commonly regulated one chemical at a time. A study conducted by a group of Johns Hopkins researchers found that “fence line” residents are at higher risk for multiple health problems because of the toxic mix of air they breathe.

Astronomer Philip Plait wondered what it would be like to walk on Mars, fall into a black hole, or fly through a nebula, so he wrote a book, &lt;em&gt;Under Alien Skies: A Sightseer’s Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. He reveals the strange colors of a sunset on Mars, what it’s like on a planet orbiting binary stars, the unique challenges of landing on an asteroid, and more.

The summertime magic of fireflies lighting up at dusk is facing threats because of climate change and habitat destruction. Living on Earth’s Ashanti Mclean shares a few tips that can help to protect firefly species. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00032&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal Self-Medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
A paper published in the journal Scientific Reports describes the case study of an orangutan who treated and healed his own wound. Zoologists have long seen behaviors of self-medicating in the animal kingdom, but until now it has rarely if ever been documented in scientific literature. Michael Huffman, an ecologist who reviewed the paper, discusses how some animals heal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Internship Applications Open!</title><link href="/internship-applications-open.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-08-11:/internship-applications-open.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-08-11&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intern Applications Open!&lt;/strong&gt; We are now accepting applications for our Fall 2025 internship program, which you can find out more about by &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/about/jobs.html"&gt;clicking here.&lt;/a&gt; We have never once asked an intern to fetch us a cup of coffee!

Eels play an important ecological role in many rivers and streams, but they’re so eel-usive that even eel scientists have been challenged to observe them mating in the wild. Ellen Ruppel Shell is author of the book &lt;em&gt;Slippery Beast: A True Crime Natural History, with Eels&lt;/em&gt;, and she speaks with Host Paloma Beltran about the eel’s murky ecology and path through the seafood industry.

The relentless heating of the Earth is prompting people to move after climate-related catastrophes and amid more gradual changes. Journalist Abrahm Lustgarten is the author of &lt;em&gt;On the Move: The Overheating Earth and the Uprooting of America&lt;/em&gt;, and he talks with Host Steve Curwood about the northward migration he anticipates as Americans seek to escape punishing heat, fire, and drought.

Stargazing has profoundly shaped who we are as human beings, and gave rise to science, religion, and origin stories from diverse traditions. Cosmologist Roberto Trotta explores this legacy in his book &lt;em&gt;Starborn: How the Stars Made Us (And Who We Would Be Without Them)&lt;/em&gt;. He joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss how studying the night sky shaped science and why satellites now threaten our connection to the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Reruns have begun!</title><link href="/reruns-have-begun.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-08-01:/reruns-have-begun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-08-01&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reruns Have Begun Hello LoE listeners!

&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00030#feature3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censorship in US National Parks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
President Trump has ordered the Department of the Interior to review historic monuments and memorials, and remove any content that might be perceived as negative or unpatriotic. Independent historian Donna Graves joined host Aynsley O’Neill to discuss some National Parks that show America’s complex history and how these federal actions can lead to censorship. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00030#feature4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zombie Fires in Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
Wildfire season has scorched nearly 14 million acres in Canada this year, degrading air quality as far downwind as Montreal, Detroit and Philadelphia. A particularly dangerous kind of wildfire, known as “zombie fire”, can survive through the winter months by smoldering underground. Professor of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University Patrick Louchouarn joined Living on Earth’s executive producer Steve Curwood to discuss this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry></feed>
