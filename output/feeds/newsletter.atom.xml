Hi Living on Earth listeners! This week we finally get to share with you something we’ve been working on for the last few months: our special about wildfire threats and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by climate disruption, decades of fire suppression, and development in fire-prone areas, wildfire disasters are now hitting US communities so frequently that it’s easy to become desensitized to them. So, we wanted to take a step back and look at some other aspects of wildfire beyond what you might hear during an acute disaster itself. We knew we didn’t want to shy away from some hard truths, but we also wanted to include plenty of hope. Here’s the rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We talked with a Stanford University professor about his research into wildfire smoke and mortality and learned that wildfire smoke currently kills around 40,000 people in the U.S. every year, on par with U.S. car crash fatalities each year. (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We welcomed back a formerly incarcerated firefighter to discuss the big pay raise California incarcerated firefighters just received. (They were previously paid just $5-10 &lt;em&gt;a day&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We discussed the mental health impacts of wildfire and some ways to cope, as yours truly shared what it was like when the 2003 Cedar Fire hit my hometown of San Diego.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We learned about how some Oregon streams and fish are showing surprising resilience after extremely intense wildfires in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we spoke with a Cree-Métis Indigenous person who practices and advocates for “good fire" — or low-intensity, cultural burning — to not only reduce fuels, but also to rekindle traditions and cultivate healthier ecosystems.
&lt;em&gt;The ghostly limbs of a large Manzanita bush that succumbed to the 2003 Cedar Fire in San Diego County but re-sprouted lush new growth in the years afterwards. (Photo: Jenni Doering)&lt;/em&gt;
If you like this show, we think you’ll also enjoy these previous LOE stories about people and nature recovering from extreme wildfire. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00003&amp;amp;segmentID=2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwood Rebirth After Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Nearly all the tall coast redwoods in California’s Big Basin Redwoods State Park burned in a 2020 wildfire. But within a few months, the charred trunks had grown a fuzz of healthy green shoots. A paper documents how the trees were able to regenerate using energy reserves stored for many decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00002&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildfires Bring 'Climate Trauma'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Wildfires like those that hit southern California in January 2025 take an enormous social and psychological toll on victims and observers alike. We hear how people and communities can heal from the ‘climate trauma’ brought by wildfires and other disasters linked to the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00009&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Brancaccio on Fire Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
The thousands of homes that burned in Los Angeles this January included the home of Marketplace Morning Report Host David Brancaccio. He shares what he’s learning about the challenges of rebuilding with a limited supply and huge demand for contractors. David says there’s an opportunity to rebuild a more wildfire-resistant Altadena, and to heal the community itself. 
And we checked back in with David Brancaccio this fall to hear about his hopes to rebuild with fire-resistant material: &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00043&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;Building Back Better After Wildfire&lt;/a&gt; 
  
&lt;strong&gt;We want to hear from you!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do you have a story of recovery or rethinking your relationship with wildfire you’d like to share?&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First find a quiet place without wind or other background noises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an app like &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134"&gt;Voice Memos&lt;/a&gt; (iPhone) or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.media.bestrecorder.audiorecorder&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;Voice Recorder&lt;/a&gt; (Android) and hold your phone up, but not right in front of your mouth. Close but a little off to the side is better, like you were actually talking on the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then please hit record and tell us your story in 2 minutes or less. We’d also love to hear your name, where you live, and what radio station you listen to LOE on, or whether you listen to the podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re done, you can email us the file at &lt;a href="mailto:comments@loe.org"&gt;comments@loe.org&lt;/a&gt;. And we might feature your story on the show down the road!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now – time to digest those delicious &lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00047&amp;amp;segmentID=3"&gt;Thanksgiving Feast Favorites&lt;/a&gt; we cooked up for last week’s show. &lt;/p&gt;

Through a tumultuous year for public radio, Living on Earth has continued to grow and thrive, &lt;a href="https://loe.org/about/donate.html"&gt;thanks as always in great part to you, our listeners and readers&lt;/a&gt;. Here are just a few of our accomplishments we wanted to share. 
  
&lt;strong&gt;LoE Interns&lt;/strong&gt; 
Living on Earth’s internship program is closing in on 400 participants across our 34 years of broadcast. LoE interns have gone on to careers as journalists and professors, among many other professions. One LoE intern alum went on to serve as the mayor of Princeton, New Jersey. LoE interns bring incredible energy, enthusiasm, and new ideas to the Living on Earth editorial process.  
  
By the way, if you or someone you know might be interested in a Living on Earth internship, this is “last call” to apply for Spring 2026 by Wednesday, November 26th! Learn more &lt;a href="https://loe.org/about/jobs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  
  
&lt;strong&gt;Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media&lt;/strong&gt; 
The &lt;a href="https://cejm.media/"&gt;Living on Earth Center for Climate and Environmental Justice Media&lt;/a&gt;, based at the University of Massachusetts Boston &lt;a href="https://www.umb.edu/environment/"&gt;School for the Environment&lt;/a&gt;, tells compelling stories of environmental and climate justice through radio broadcasts, podcasts, and multi-media communications, while also providing media instruction for UMass Boston students and faculty. The Center draws voices from a broad diversity of experiences, striving to fairly and accurately inform local, regional, and global communities about today’s and tomorrow’s critical environmental and climate justice concerns. 
  
CEJM hosted its first ever conference at UMass Boston on September 17-18, with more than 200 attendees. The conference featured Dr. Robert Bullard, father of environmental justice and Distinguished Professor at Texas Southern University, Dr. David Cash, the newly appointed Director of Harvard’s Climate Action Accelerator, and Goldman Environmental Prize winner Nalleli Cobo. The event brought together environmental justice leaders and community activists from all around the country.  
  
&lt;strong&gt;LoE Stories&lt;/strong&gt; 
A key part of every week at Living on Earth is our conversation about the past week’s program. The entire LoE team listens to every episode and shares thoughts about what we loved and potential refinements to future episodes. Heading into the holiday season seems like a great time to share a few of the stories that were favorites for the LoE team this past year. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00035&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oyster Trash to Treasure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Oysters on the half shell are big business on Nantucket Island, and a local program recycles oyster shells from restaurant waste into habitat for young oysters. Host Aynsley O’Neill reports on how these recycled oyster shell reefs are helping to protect the coastline from worsening storms and rising seas. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00020&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pope Leo and Creation Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
The new Pope, Leo XIV, has worked with interfaith environmental networks and there’s hope around the world that he may follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Pope Francis and bring issues of the environment and climate change to the forefront of his agenda. Dr. Erin Lothes is a former professor of Catholic theology who now promotes global eco spirituality education and climate action with the Laudato Si’ Movement and she joins Host Aynsley O’Neill to shed light on Pope Leo XIV’s rhetoric on environment. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00013&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deb Haaland on Our Public Lands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
Deb Haaland became the first Native American cabinet member when President Biden appointed her as Secretary of the Interior and helped consult with tribes to designate new national monuments. Now she’s running for Governor of New Mexico, and Deb Haaland joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss the current threats to public lands and her deep ancestral connections to the New Mexican landscape

Turn on your flashlight and grab the covers, because I’m going to tell you a horror story about one of the deadliest killers in American history – and it’s not who you think it is.  
  
It’s 1961, and our killer is on the loose. It haunts cities like Tacoma, Washington and El Paso, Texas. But really it’s everywhere. It infiltrates your every breath, bubbles in your bathwater, and seeps into your brain. And it goes largely unnoticed. Until strange things start happening. 
  
You start to get headaches and nausea. The children in your neighborhood fall behind in school, experience developmental delays and behavioral problems. There’s a sharp rise in violence and crime. The news fills with stories of kidnappings and murders. You’re told to lock your doors, to stay inside after dark. But it doesn’t matter. Our killer can’t be stopped by a curfew. 
  
It’s in the air – pumped out by huge, towering smelters and every car that drives by. The smell is awful, but they tell you it’s normal. The smokestacks symbolize industry, growth, and pride. The smelter becomes one of the landmarks of your beloved city. Our killer is celebrated throughout the country. 
  
Have you guessed it yet? 
  
Lead. 
  
A powerful neurotoxin, known today to cause kidney damage, infertility, and increased aggression and impulsivity in those exposed. At higher levels, lead poisoning can be fatal. For decades, lead poured into the environment from smelters, paint, pipes, and every gallon of leaded gasoline burned. The fallout poisoned our water and air, and warped young minds, potentially even helping to shape the violent impulses of future serial killers. 
  
This is a story that Caroline Fraser, one of our guests this week, knows all too well. Her newest book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20556/9780593657225"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, links high lead exposure in children in the 1950s and 60s to the sharp rise in serial killers in the 70s and 80s, including infamous murderers like Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway, and Richard Ramirez. Fraser documents how companies, such as the American Smelting and Refining Company, also known as Asarco, poisoned our world while selling us a dream of progress wrapped in smoke and profit. She reminds us that the deadliest killers are often unseen, unheard, and unchallenged.  
  
The end of this American horror story is only half-written. Asarco’s Tacoma smelter closed its doors in 1985; leaded gasoline was banned in 1996. But our killer lingers. 
  
Today, lead hides in old paint, in aging pipes, in soil near old smelter sites, and in the blood of millions of Americans. While lead doesn’t pose nearly as much of a threat now as it did 50 years ago, its legacy reminds us of the damage previous generations and our environment have endured, and warns of future ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you &lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00044&amp;amp;segmentID=3"&gt;listen to our conversation with Caroline Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, remember: this horror story only ends when we decide it will.  &lt;strong&gt;Bella Smith&lt;/strong&gt;

The Day of the Dead, or Dia de los Muertos in Spanish, is a holiday celebrated throughout Mexico and other parts of the Americas. 
  
There’s debate on the origin of the practice, but to my understanding it’s a blend of indigenous mesoamerican traditions and Catholic observances brought to the Americas by Spanish colonizers.  
  
It's a national holiday in Mexico where families and friends gather to honor their deceased loved ones. The idea is that no one who isn’t forgotten is actually dead and that by setting up a colorful altar we’ll attract and welcome the spirits of the departed back home.

This year, Dia de los Muertos is especially significant for my family since my Father recently passed away. I’ve had the restless urge to make sure he can enjoy all of the elements and tributes an altar of this kind has to offer.  
  
The concept of the holiday itself can be seen as a contradiction to traditional Christian and Catholic practices. After all, believing that objects can attract the dead back to earth does not fall in line with the purist Christian ideology. Although, many altars include general Christian imagery (like the cross) and more specific Roman Catholic religious symbols — like the image of a saint the deceased was devoted to, or whose feast day falls on the deceased’s birthday. Still, to my knowledge, you don’t have to be Christian, Roman Catholic, or belong to a specific religion to set up an altar.  
  
Let me preface this note by clarifying that I’m no expert in Day of the Dead altars, but here’s a bit of what I’ve learned through the years and this planning process.  
  
Traditional altars are colorful, maximalist, and full of life! 
  
Altars can have 2 levels representing heaven and earth, 3 levels representing heaven purgatory and earth, or the more elaborate 7 levels representing different steps to heaven. The seven layers may also represent the different stages to reach Mictlan, the underworld of Mexica mythology.  
  
Like a lot of families throughout Mexico, we usually celebrate Dia de los Muertos by visiting a cemetery, but that won’t be possible for my partner and I this time around. So we decided to go all out and build a 7 tier altar for our loved ones. (&lt;a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/life/faith/2022/10/31/how-to-create-an-altar-for-dia-de-los-muertos/69587073007/"&gt;more on how to build different layer altars&lt;/a&gt;)

Day of the Dead altars can be dedicated to family, friends, mentors — basically anyone who’s passed away and you’d like to commemorate and celebrate.  
  
There’s even a day of the dead dedicated to pets on October 27! (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2025/10/25/day-of-the-dead-pets-ofrendas/"&gt;more on that here&lt;/a&gt;).  
  
It doesn’t have to be expensive or an elaborate structure. We’re going the eco-friendly route and using cardboard boxes to set up the layers.  
  
Because of how place and community shapes culture, the specifics on what to incorporate vary across regions and family traditions.  
  
Altares (or alters) represent a connection to the circle of life as well as the four elements of nature: water, wind, fire and earth. 
  
Water: Altars traditionally incorporate a glass of water to signify purity. 
  
Wind: The light and delicate texture of papel picado or perforated paper represents wind and the fragility of life. Some say the holes in the tissue paper make it possible for the souls to travel and visit us.
Papel picado is not only placed in Dia de los Muertos altars but also adorns the streets of Mexico .

Fire: Lit candles, which serve to light the path and guide the spirits of the deceased home. 
  
Earth: Seeds, fruits and food. Since we’re dedicating the altar to multiple people, we plan on cooking up a feast as well as purchasing from local shops. Tamales, bacalao, and seafood. Agua de horchata and cold beer will also be part of this tier because who wouldn’t want to be received with a cool beverage after a long journey! 
  
Copal, an aromatic incense to purify the environment.  
  
At the bottom of the altar, we’ll be placing the flor de cempasuchil petals. It's a flower native to Mexico known as the Mexican marigold. Its colorful orange and yellow petals, as well as its fragrant smells, are meant to attract and guide the departed back home.

Personal objects: 
  
To honor my father’s connection to the earth and agriculture, we’re incorporating alfalfa, cotton flowers and a bit of dirt from the fields he worked on and loved dearly.  
  
Planning an altar this year has led to long phone calls with aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. with the intention of learning more about our loved ones. It’s healing to cherish the joys that our beloved enjoyed, they’re favorite foods, what they loved about this earth and to be able to receive them.  
  
Like Elida Guardia Bonet mentioned back in 2011 during a Living Earth &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=11-P13-00051&amp;amp;segmentID=2"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the Day of the Dead, “You're celebrating the afterlife but you're also celebrating the life that you shared with those people here, on earth.” 
  
In my opinion, the Day of the Dead can be celebrated by anyone who’s moved to do so as long as it’s done respectfully. &lt;/p&gt;

The sight of hundreds of swimmers jumping into the waterway that runs through the heart of downtown Chicago marked the culmination of more than four decades of collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies and environmental groups, including the nonprofit Friends of the Chicago River. 
  
Friends of the Chicago River was founded in 1979, not long after cofounder Robert Cassidy published the essay “The Friendless River,” where he decried the decades of abuse and neglect that had transformed the Chicago River from a great natural resource into an open sewer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Chicago River is the city's most neglected natural resource,” Cassidy wrote. “It is overshadowed by Lake Michigan, disdained by environmentalists and outdoorsmen alike, neglected, fouled, and abused by industry and by all the rest of us. Nonetheless, it is the second greatest gift that nature has bestowed on this city.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River, joins &lt;em&gt;Living on Earth&lt;/em&gt; in this week’s show to share the inspiring story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she tells it, the 156-mile Chicago River has amazing history wrapped up in engineering marvel. The river once flowed east into Lake Michigan, the source of drinking water for Chicago and surrounding areas. However, the river was always treated like a stepchild. It had long been the receptacle of the area’s untreated sewage and stormwater runoff.  In 1900, to protect the quality of Lake Michigan, engineers reversed the Chicago River. It now flows into the west from Lake Michigan to the Des Plaines River, before it joins the Mississippi River system, which meanders south before it empties into the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, with the growth of the city, sewage plagued the river. Spills occurred regularly. In response, during the 1970s, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) came up with the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP), one of the most ambitious and expensive public works projects in the region’s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Deep Tunnel, TARP is a system of deep, large diameter tunnels and vast reservoirs designed to reduce flooding, improve water quality in Chicago area waterways, and protect Lake Michigan from pollution caused by sewer overflows, especially during periods of heavy rainfall, according to MWRD. Construction began in 1975 and is still underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the project is complete, likely in 2032, TARP will be able to hold 17.5 billion gallons. That is more than 4,666 gallons for each person in its service area, MWRD boasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first portions of the system became operational in 1981, TARP has captured over a trillion gallons of combined sewage, according to MWRD. That’s contaminated water that could have ended up in the Chicago River. 
  
The cleaner Chicago River is not just a triumph of science and engineering. Frisbie said it’s also a major cultural milestone. Longtime area residents found it hard to imagine the river as a place to swim. They saw the river as a place to dump sewage – except on St. Patrick’s Day, when it’s dyed green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the billion-dollar infrastructure projects, the river has benefitted from green infrastructure initiatives like swamp and marsh reclamation, restoring habitats for native species, and building walking trails. It’s crucial to build resilience in the face of climate change, Frisbie warns us. Given the warming of the planet, extreme rainfall events will tax TARP’s capacity. 
  
Still, Frisbie believes other cities with polluted urban waterways can learn from Chicago. The story of the Chicago River’s restoration is one of collaboration, persistence and not taking no for an answer, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restored health of the Chicago River gives us reason to hope. &lt;/p&gt;

Senior Project Director / Senior Producer&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Remembering Jane Goodall</title><link href="/remembering-jane-goodall.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-10-08:/remembering-jane-goodall.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-10-08&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remembering Jane Goodall Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Sophie, and I recently joined Living on Earth as an editorial intern. As Living on Earth joins the world in mourning the loss of primatologist, conservationist, and humanitarian Dr. Jane Goodall, I wanted to share how her recent passing has compelled me to reflect on a chapter of my own life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I remember learning of Dr. Goodall’s experiences living among chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania, during which she observed apes displaying behaviors previously thought to be uniquely human. After her breakthrough discovery in 1960 – that chimps create and use tools – she continued to document similarities between chimpanzees and humankind. Through her fieldwork, Goodall observed that, like us, chimpanzees are sentient, intelligent, social beings who show compassion and experience emotions like joy and grief. By immersing herself fully in their world, she taught us that we are not alone in our ability to form strong family bonds and friendships, nor in our tendency to wage war against our enemies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve witnessed primates display many of these behaviors firsthand. Before I got my start in journalism, a combination of my educational background and lifelong love of animals landed me in behavioral research laboratories where I spent several years working very closely with monkeys. I saw that monkeys can learn to complete complex tasks, discriminate between their favorite foods, and even maim one another in a bloody competition to win the title of alpha female. The context for my work was utterly different, and yet, I thought of Jane Goodall often. She was there between the high-pitched shrieks of excitement from a baby marmoset learning to pick up a live mealworm for the first time. I thought of her work as I watched a cotton-top tamarin monkey bring fruit to an aging female too weak to gather her own and, later, as he called out for her, repeatedly, in sadness and confusion after the older monkey’s death.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young women trailblazing the male-dominated field of primatology research, Jane Goodall had to fight back hard against those who told her that scientists must be coldly objective. She argued that not only was it possible to be both scientifically accurate and empathetic to the animals she studied, but that it was, in fact, a strength. My own deep empathy for animals, which had drawn me to work with them initially, positioned me to advocate for their improved well-being, always pushing for measures that would increase their joy and minimize their pain. That same empathy was also why I declined to continue working with the lab as it transitioned to more invasive research procedures. I left the field in search of something more aligned with my belief that all living beings deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, a value no doubt informed by Goodall’s revelations and perseverance.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jane Goodall’s legacy stretches far beyond her ground-breaking scientific findings. Perhaps her greatest contributions to the world can be found in her conservation and humanitarian efforts. The last time Jane Goodall was interviewed on Living on Earth in 2023, she told us that she started her youth conservation program back in 1991, Roots and Shoots, because many young people were losing hope about our world, angered by older generations compromising their future and feeling hopeless and apathetic. “Well, we have compromised their future,” she begins, “in fact we’ve been stealing it, we still are.” But she showed them that hope was not yet lost. “There’s a window of time, if we get together, we can start to heal some of the scars we’ve inflicted on poor old planet Earth, slow down climate change, slow down loss of biodiversity.” For nearly 35 years, Jane Goodall shared this message with millions of people around the world, galvanizing the youth conservation movement then and now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fear that this window is shrinking. Though we will miss the kindness and humanity she showed as a leader in this movement, this isn’t a time for slowing down our efforts. There is still so much work to be done. For me, to celebrate Jane Goodall is not only to reflect on her remarkable past but to challenge ourselves to create a more sustainable future for our planet, one that honors her lifelong commitment to the dignity of all living beings and actualizes her harmonious vision for our natural world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jane Goodall once said that “Every single one of us makes a difference every day – it is up to us as to the kind of difference we make.” I strive to live by these words and honor her legacy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deep gratitude, 
&lt;strong&gt;Sophie Bokor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Meet Jade!</title><link href="/meet-jade.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-09-29:/meet-jade.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-09-29&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meet Jade Hello, LOE listeners! 
  
My name is Jade, and I'm one of LOE's interns this fall! I’m big into storytelling and care deeply about our environment. So of course, getting the chance to immerse myself in the inner workings of a nonprofit organization focused on sharing environmental news through audio storytelling was an opportunity I couldn’t say no to. 
  
A little bit about me: I'm a recent graduate from Bryn Mawr College, right outside Philadelphia, where I majored in creative writing and minored in psychology and gender/sexuality studies. As a liberal arts gal, I chose writing as my medium of choice because the topics to explore are endless. I’m often found roaming the interdisciplinary forests hoping to find hidden connections.  In this next season of my career journey, I’m moving into the world of environmental exploration, whether it pertains to science, politics, or culture. Of course, our environment and our social experiences heavily overlap — those are the stories I can’t wait to unearth! There’s a ton of captivating research out there, but sometimes it’s hard to decipher what it really means in the context of our everyday lives. That’s where things get fun — by intertwining scientific voices with the language of everyday life, we create digestible, captivating stories that both inform and intrigue. 
  
Although I thought prose and poetry were the only forms of writing I’d encountered during my undergrad, I ended up taking a course on writing for radio and podcasts in which a new love for media writing, production, and investigation bloomed. My professor brought in a bunch of media experts, and I finally saw what a career in the writing world could manifest into — yes, I could still delve into literature through an academic lens and write short stories, but I didn’t need to make it my career. The question “what should I pursue after college?” had less hazy answers after taking the media writing course. I finally could see myself outside of college, working in public radio, and helping produce a plethora of stories. 
  
One of my favorite aspects of the production process is pulling together tape from interviews and transforming it into something digestible, informative, and engaging. I’ve always considered myself to be very visual — so why does audio have such a sparkle in my view? Well, despite the fact that your eyes can be closed while consuming a podcast, it’s indeed a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; visual format! Like a book, you have the pleasure of creating your own imagery which makes listening that much more personal. 
  
I’m so excited to continue my storytelling journey with LOE this fall! LOE’s program is built to allow us interns to really sink our teeth into the full production process, and I look forward to what’s to come. 
  
Cheers! &lt;/p&gt;

During those two days, speakers from around the country came to share their community stories and urge attendees to not only practice hope, but also to engage in the work necessary to make sure all communities have a voice to assure access to clean water, air, and land.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few key quotes from the conference that highlight this message: 
  
“Our environmental and climate justice movement was not birthed in government. It was not funded by federal dollars. It was birthed out of struggle. And it will continue to progress and move forward. We don’t have a reverse on this bus!” ~ Dr. Robert Bullard, the Father of Environmental Justice 
  
“I think part of it is if we can remove the article ‘the’ before we say environment… For communities that I’ve worked with, it’s very intimate… so they call it ‘my air,’ ‘my water,’ ‘my land.’” ~Monique Harden, Former Director of Law and Policy and the Community Engagement Program Manager at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice 
  
“Instead of playing defence and thinking about how we’re going to not lose more, we ought to be just really boldly looking at what kind of world we want.” ~  Dr. Meghan Kallman, RI State Senator and Associate Professor at UMass Boston’s School for Global Inclusion &amp;amp; Social Development 
  
“Fear is temporary, but regret is forever. So my question to you all is: Are you going to stand up and demand climate action and environmental justice for our generation and the next and those to follow? Or are you going to wait until it’s your life on the line?” ~ Nalleli Cobo, Activist and Storyteller, Peace is Loud, Los Angeles, CA 
  
“We must continue to transform fear into hope, oppression into liberation, injustice into justice, and hatred into love.” ~ Rev. Benjamin Chavis, President and CEO of the National Newspaper

Perseverance at the Public Media Conference You might have heard that public media is going through a hard time. (Perhaps the understatement of the century.) Congress rolled back $1.1 billion of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) this July. Shortly after, CPB, which brought us everything from &lt;em&gt;Arthur&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Nova&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5489808/cpb-shut-down-public-broadcasting-trump"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be shutting down. Federal funding for public media is no more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station managers are having to &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/08/south-dakota-public-broadcasting-to-reduce-workforce-by-25/"&gt;lay off colleagues&lt;/a&gt; and cut programming. They’re &lt;a href="https://kuac.org/faq-kuac-broadcasting-changes/"&gt;turning off transmitters overnight&lt;/a&gt;. And some stations, like &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/09/university-to-begin-wind-down-of-wpsu-after-acquisition-vote-fails/"&gt;WPSU in Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be headed for outright closure. In rural areas, public radio is often the primary and sometimes the only source of local journalism. If these stations disappear, who will keep residents informed about the news that impacts their lives? How will voters understand vital issues at play in elections? Our already-fragile democracy may not survive the disappearance of public media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I headed to this year’s big public radio conference in Salt Lake City in August, a part of me wondered if the mood would be muted, even grim. Something akin to an emergency room where all heroic life-saving efforts had failed. I worried my energy and enthusiasm for this beleaguered field would be sapped. I imagined having to steel myself to find the will to keep producing content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my relief and delight, I found the complete opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who make public radio possible are hardly throwing in the towel. Instead, they’re eager to innovate, experiment with new ways of reaching audiences, and deepen connections with local listeners. They’re determined to make lemonade out of this very sour situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/08/ira-glass-to-pubmedia-the-time-of-invention-does-not-need-to-be-over/"&gt;keynote&lt;/a&gt;, Ira Glass of &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; reminded us that despite the funding cuts, it’s an “enormously energizing moment to be on the radio and doing journalism” at a time when “this country is wrenching itself through such seismic changes. To be able to witness that and to capture it and to have the privilege to go out with microphones and people will talk to you about it … I just feel, like, what could be more interesting?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, these producers and program directors are just a wonderfully warm, genuine bunch. This was my first time attending the content conference run by PMCC, the Public Media Content Collective. I finally had the chance to meet program directors from the stations that air &lt;em&gt;Living on Earth&lt;/em&gt; – Jonathan Blakley of WYPR in Baltimore, Cheryl Snyder of KTOO in Alaska, Tristan Clum of KUNM in Albuquerque, and Michael Marsolek of Montana Public Radio to name a few. It felt like a family reunion — without any of the drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, public radio creators love to entertain as well as inform, and the conference featured among other things an energetic live taping at a local brewery of the history and pop culture gameshow “&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/1255528265/who-what-when"&gt;Who What When&lt;/a&gt;,” from South Carolina Public Radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off with some wild joy and delight, BirdNote® partnered with a &lt;a href="https://www.longwingbirds.com/"&gt;local bird expert&lt;/a&gt; to bring in magnificent Eurasian eagle owls, who swooped down the hotel ballroom… and a cockatoo named Gidget who moonlights as a hairstylist!     
   
Much of the fighting spirit among everyone at the conference comes from you, the listeners who &lt;a href="https://current.org/2025/07/donors-stepping-up-to-bolster-stations-after-cpb-funding-cuts/"&gt;showed up spectacularly&lt;/a&gt; during recent emergency pledge drives. You all are why we keep making the best radio we can. We yak on the air about this a lot, I know, but you are essential to keeping public radio alive. By pitching in with your hard-earned dollars, but also, and more importantly, by being a part of this community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I don’t want to minimize the difficult months ahead for our public radio colleagues across the country. Even the groundswell of listener support, and the &lt;a href="https://publicmedia.co/bridge-fund/"&gt;Public Media Bridge Fund&lt;/a&gt; effort from major philanthropies, are not enough to make up the lost funding. Public media creators will need to channel all the strength and resolve we can to get through the coming months. With the stakes so high — democracy itself is on the line — we must. And we will!  &lt;strong&gt;Jenni Doering&lt;/strong&gt;

Not because I was good at it — it was only thanks to hours of tutoring that I scraped by with a B. Not because I liked my teacher — she was so queerphobic that she wouldn't allow her children to interact with me during Take Your Child to Work Day. But because it taught me that the world was made of chemicals. Before grasping the basics of chemistry, the air was just air. Water was water. The books on my shelves were mere paper. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6wpNhyreDE"&gt;Cookies were flour, sugar, and butter.&lt;/a&gt; Stuff was what it was.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning chemistry flips this worldview on its head. Though we tend to think of "chemicals" as mysterious substances that could potentially poison us, all matter is made from chemicals. Your thoughts are a series of chemical reactions. Your pants are held together with chemical bonds. The air you breathe is all chemicals, including the oxygen you need to survive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding this opens up a world of creativity to scientists trying to tackle the plastic waste problem. &lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00036&amp;amp;segmentID=3"&gt;This week on the show&lt;/a&gt;, we hear from Dr. Stephen Wallace whose team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01845-5"&gt;figured out how to alter &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to produce a series of enzymes that turn a key component of plastic waste into acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. Acetaminophen, like over half of our pharmaceuticals, is derived from fossil fuels. This means that the production of pharmaceuticals not only contributes to the climate crisis, but that if we're not careful, humanity could run out of the fossil fuels needed to make life saving medications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dr. Wallace's mind, though, fossil fuels are mostly carbon. And so is most waste. Since &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=18-P13-00007&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt;, like the vast majority of living things, love carbon, he sees potential in every empty plastic bottle. His research focuses on how we can harness microorganisms to turn our waste into something new. In addition to his work turning plastic bottles into acetaminophen, he's also contributed to research that aims to convert &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/12/550465000/behold-the-fatberg-london-s-130-ton-rock-solid-sewer-blockage"&gt;sewer waste&lt;/a&gt; into perfume. That's right. Sewer waste into perfume. Perfume is made from carbon. And sewer waste is mostly carbon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of science as something that makes the world less wondrous. Concrete, rational explanations are boring, after all. But once you get down into the nitty gritty details about how reality works, even the pen sitting on your &lt;a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2012/10/visual-history-school-desks"&gt;desk&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. And when we harness this wonder, we can use it to make the world a better place. One carbon molecule at a time. &lt;/p&gt;

Last week’s reruns covered everything from air pollution, to orangutans, and even our relationship to outer space. It also included a new segment about the fate of fireflies. In case you missed it, you are welcome to check out the links below.  
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00032&amp;amp;segmentID=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Air Pollution and Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
Thousands of people across the United States live near industrial facilities and petrochemical plants that expose them to higher levels of air pollution, but chemical exposure risk is commonly regulated one chemical at a time. A study conducted by a group of Johns Hopkins researchers found that “fence line” residents are at higher risk for multiple health problems because of the toxic mix of air they breathe.

Astronomer Philip Plait wondered what it would be like to walk on Mars, fall into a black hole, or fly through a nebula, so he wrote a book, &lt;em&gt;Under Alien Skies: A Sightseer’s Guide to the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. He reveals the strange colors of a sunset on Mars, what it’s like on a planet orbiting binary stars, the unique challenges of landing on an asteroid, and more.

The summertime magic of fireflies lighting up at dusk is facing threats because of climate change and habitat destruction. Living on Earth’s Ashanti Mclean shares a few tips that can help to protect firefly species. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=25-P13-00032&amp;amp;segmentID=4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal Self-Medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
A paper published in the journal Scientific Reports describes the case study of an orangutan who treated and healed his own wound. Zoologists have long seen behaviors of self-medicating in the animal kingdom, but until now it has rarely if ever been documented in scientific literature. Michael Huffman, an ecologist who reviewed the paper, discusses how some animals heal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Internship Applications Open!</title><link href="/internship-applications-open.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-08-11:/internship-applications-open.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-08-11&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intern Applications Open!&lt;/strong&gt; We are now accepting applications for our Fall 2025 internship program, which you can find out more about by &lt;a href="https://www.loe.org/about/jobs.html"&gt;clicking here.&lt;/a&gt; We have never once asked an intern to fetch us a cup of coffee!

Eels play an important ecological role in many rivers and streams, but they’re so eel-usive that even eel scientists have been challenged to observe them mating in the wild. Ellen Ruppel Shell is author of the book &lt;em&gt;Slippery Beast: A True Crime Natural History, with Eels&lt;/em&gt;, and she speaks with Host Paloma Beltran about the eel’s murky ecology and path through the seafood industry.

The relentless heating of the Earth is prompting people to move after climate-related catastrophes and amid more gradual changes. Journalist Abrahm Lustgarten is the author of &lt;em&gt;On the Move: The Overheating Earth and the Uprooting of America&lt;/em&gt;, and he talks with Host Steve Curwood about the northward migration he anticipates as Americans seek to escape punishing heat, fire, and drought.

Stargazing has profoundly shaped who we are as human beings, and gave rise to science, religion, and origin stories from diverse traditions. Cosmologist Roberto Trotta explores this legacy in his book &lt;em&gt;Starborn: How the Stars Made Us (And Who We Would Be Without Them)&lt;/em&gt;. He joins Host Jenni Doering to discuss how studying the night sky shaped science and why satellites now threaten our connection to the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry><entry><title>Reruns have begun!</title><link href="/reruns-have-begun.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name/></author><id>tag:None,2025-08-01:/reruns-have-begun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newsletter from 2025-08-01&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reruns Have Begun Hello LoE listeners! 
  
For the month of August, we will be airing reruns of previous segments. Not only does this allow us to highlight of some of our most powerful and engaging stories, but it gives us time to work on longer-term projects. We hope you enjoy these shows as much as we do! 
  
This means that last week was our last live show until September. If you haven’t gotten a chance to listen in, feel free to check out the links below.

President Trump has ordered the Department of the Interior to review historic monuments and memorials, and remove any content that might be perceived as negative or unpatriotic. Independent historian Donna Graves joined host Aynsley O’Neill to discuss some National Parks that show America’s complex history and how these federal actions can lead to censorship. 
  
&lt;a href="https://loe.org/shows/shows.html?programID=25-P13-00030#feature4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zombie Fires in Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
  
Wildfire season has scorched nearly 14 million acres in Canada this year, degrading air quality as far downwind as Montreal, Detroit and Philadelphia. A particularly dangerous kind of wildfire, known as “zombie fire”, can survive through the winter months by smoldering underground. Professor of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University Patrick Louchouarn joined Living on Earth’s executive producer Steve Curwood to discuss this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletter"/></entry></feed>
